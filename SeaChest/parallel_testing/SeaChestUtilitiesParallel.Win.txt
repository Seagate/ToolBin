Information About Running SeaChest Utilities in Parallel on Multiple Devices

Seagate SeaChest Utilities are not multi-threaded applications.  While it is
possible to define multiple target devices on the command line, these devices
are processed sequentially, not simultaneously.  Some tests, like the full
drive scan, can take several hours to complete.  It is understandable for
testing multiple drives, therefore, to seek to process them in parallel.

Fortunately, this support is readily available for the Windows operating system
using sophisticated PowerShell scripts.  Two such projects are "Invoke-Parallel" and "PoshRSJob".

First, an important message:

Running SeaChest Utilities using various parallel methods can easily overwhelm
a system.  As the system administrator you are responsible for evaluating how
your systems might react to multiple storage devices running various
diagnostics routines.  Will there be memory issues?  What is the safe number of
parallel tests to run at one time?  Is the power supply ready to support
numerous active drives?  Will there be network issues when the tasks are on
different systems?  What should be the response when a drive fails a diagnostic
test?  Do you have a  way to identify and kill an unresponsive instance of the
tests?  Will there be clean up routines and processes that need be halted when
the tests are finished?  These are only a few of the many obvious questions
that need to be considered before implementing a parallel testing plan.

===============================================================================
Invoke-Parallel

The Invoke-Parallel PowerShell script has many available options.  Only a few of
them are needed for running SeaChest utilities in parallel.

Example 1:
=========
2,3 | Invoke-Parallel -ScriptBlock { \\Path\To\SeaChest_GenericTests.exe -d PD$_ --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine }

The above command will start two drives testing simultaneously for 5 seconds.
(You can touch the multiple drives and feel the random seeks in your hands.)

Let's review the parts of the above command line:

1. 2,3: these are the comma separated physical device (PD) variables which
replace the $_ placeholder characters resulting in two parallel tests, one for
PD2 and another for PD3.
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD2 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD3 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine

2. |: the pipe symbol.  This symbol tells the operating system to pass the
preceding variables 2,3 into the script.

3. Invoke-Parallel:  The PowerShell script for executing jobs in parallel using
one or more computers.  The location of this script is known because you
previously did a dot-source link to the file
(. "\\Path\To\Invoke-Parallel.ps1") in preparation to running the script.

4. the -ScriptBlock option: An Invoke-Parallel command line option setting up
the scriptblock (a collection of statements surrounded with { curly parenthesis
}) to run against selected devices and computers.

5. { : the starting 'curly parenthesis and space' of the scriptblock which
frames the command you might use for a single device.  For example, the actual
command would be: SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD2 --randomTest --seconds 5
--hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine

6. \\Path\To\: Just a simplified representation of the drive and directory
location of the SeaChest utility about to be run.  For example, it might be on
a flash drive at G:\commandline_tools\Windows\Win64\

7. SeaChest_GenericTests: This is the application name in this example. You
will change this to the name of the tool you want to use. The application file
will end with letters .exe.  Typing these letters is optional.

8. -d PD: These are SeaChest device designations.  See the SeaChest
documentation for more details.

9. $_: This a variable replacement string exclusively for the Invoke-Parallel
script. It tells Invoke-Parallel to expect values (letters, words or numbers)
defined previously on this command line to take the place of the $_ characters.
The count of comma separated values will determine the number of parallel
processes that will occur.

10. --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine: These are
command line options specific to the SeaChest_GenericTests application.

Note: The --hideLBACounter option is very important when running a test that
displays the LBA (sector) numbers.  These numbers can easily climb up into the
millions and they will each display on a new line after Invoke-Parallel is
finished running.  This is of course an impossible situation and if it happens
then press Ctrl-C to abort the display. This will also abort your results so
remember to use the --hideLBACounter option to avoid wasted time rerunning your
tests.

11.  }: This is the closing 'space and curly parenthesis' of the scriptblock
which frames the general command.

Example 2:
=========
With four drives testing Short Drive Self Test (DST) it would be:
0,1,4,6 | Invoke-Parallel -ScriptBlock { \\Path\To\SeaChest_Basics.exe -d PD$_ --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine }

equivalent to starting in parallel:
SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_Basics -d PD1 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_Basics -d PD4 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_Basics -d PD6 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine

The terminal will display results in the order of how they have finished the
command.  The output of a job will be printed as soon as the job completes.

In the case of a test failure, you will need to decide if all remaining tests
should complete or all current tests should stop. See the Invoke-Parallel
documentation about -RunspaceTimeout and -NoCloseOnTimeout to control this behavior.

Log files can help to keep test results reports. See the Invoke-Parallel
documentation about -AppendLog and -LogFile to control this behavior.

===============================================================================
PoshRSJob

The PoshRSJob PowerShell module has many available options.  Only a few of them
are needed for running SeaChest utilities in parallel.

Example 1:
=========
0..5 | Start-RSJob -Name {"PD$($_)"} -Throttle 3 -ScriptBlock { & '\\Path\To\SeaChest_GenericTests' -d PD$_ --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine }

The above command will start six drives testing simultaneously for 5 seconds.
(You can touch the multiple drives and feel the random seeks in your hands.)

Let's review the parts of the above command line:

1. 0..5: these are the physical device (PD) variables expressed as a range from
0 to 5 which replace the $_ placeholder characters resulting in six parallel
tests, one each for PD0, PD1, PD2, PD3, PD4, PD5, and PD6.
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD0 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD1 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD2 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD3 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD4 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD5 --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine

2. |: the pipe symbol.  This symbol tells the operating system to pass the
preceding variables 0..5 into the script.

3. Start-RSJob:  The PowerShell command from the PoshRSJob module for executing
jobs in parallel using one or more computers.  The location of this script is
known because you previously installed the module in preparation to running the
script.

4. the -Name option: A PoshRSJob command line option to assign a unique name to
each instance of the parallel tests (each background runspace job).

5. {"PD$($_)"}: A small script which assembles the names we want PD0, PD1 etc
based on the 0..5 device variables.  These will display on the screen under the
"Name" column.

6. -Throttle 3: A PoshRSJob Start-RSJob command line option to set the number
of concurrent running runspace jobs which are allowed at a time.  The value of
3 is selected for demonstration purposes only.  Your value will depend on your
chosen SeaChest Utilities task and your knowledge of your own system's
abilities, current state and limitations.  As there are six drive in this
example, they we run three at a time until all six are completed.

7. the -ScriptBlock option: A PoshRSJob Start-RSJob command line option setting
up the scriptblock (a collection of statements surrounded with { curly
parenthesis }) to run against selected devices and computers.

8. { : the starting 'curly parenthesis and space' of the scriptblock which
frames the command you might use for a single device.  For example, the actual
command would be: SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD0 --randomTest --seconds 5
--hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine

9. & '<some external command>': PowerShell interprets the ampersand (the 'and'
sign) as an instruction to execute the command surrounded by single quotes,
instead of treating it as a cmdlet or a string.

10. \\Path\To\: Just a simplified representation of the drive and directory
location of the SeaChest utility about to be run.  For example, it might be
actually be at C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest or on a flash drive at
G:\commandline_tools\Windows\Win64\.  It depends on your system.

11. SeaChest_GenericTests: This is the application name in this example. You
will change this to the name of the tool you want to use. The application file
will end with letters .exe.  Typing these letters is optional.

12. -d PD: These are SeaChest device designations.  See the SeaChest
documentation for more details.

13. $_: This a variable replacement string exclusively for the Start-RSJob
script. It tells Start-RSJob to expect values (letters, words or numbers)
defined previously on this command line to take the place of the $_ characters.

14. --randomTest --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter --echoCommandLine: These are
command line options specific to the SeaChest_GenericTests application.

Note: The --hideLBACounter option is very important when running a test that
displays the LBA (sector) numbers.  These numbers can easily climb up into the
millions and they will each display on a new line after Start-RSJob is finished
running.  This is of course an impossible situation and if it happens then
press Ctrl-C to abort the display. This will also abort your results so
remember to use the --hideLBACounter option to avoid wasted time rerunning your
tests.

15.  }: This is the closing 'space and curly parenthesis' of the scriptblock
which frames the general command.

16. Three of the PoshRSJob module commands are especially useful when running
SeaChest utilities in a parallel manner.  These modules are Start-RSJob,
Get-RSJob and Receive-RSJob.  As demonstrated avove, Start-RSJob gets things
started. It displays a single "ID" row with initial status for each instance of
the task.  For example, based on the above six drive test:

PS \\Path\To\> 0..5 | Start-RSJob -Name {"PD$($_)"} -Throttle 3 -ScriptBlock { & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest\scgt.exe' -d PD$_ --userGenericStart 10000 --seconds 5 --hideLBACounter }

Id       Name                 State           HasMoreData  HasErrors    Command
--       ----                 -----           -----------  ---------    -------
218      PD0                  Running         False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
219      PD1                  Running         False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
220      PD2                  Running         False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
221      PD3                  NotStarted      False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
222      PD4                  NotStarted      False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
223      PD5                  NotStarted      False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...

While our test example is a short five second test, a full drive scan will take
several hours and the PoshRSJob command to check status is Get-RSJob.  For
example, based on the above six drive test:

PS \\Path\To\> Get-RSJob -Id 218,219,220,221,222,223
or perhaps
218..223 | ForEach { Get-RSJob -Id $_ }

Id       Name                 State           HasMoreData  HasErrors    Command
--       ----                 -----           -----------  ---------    -------
218      PD0                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
219      PD1                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
220      PD2                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
221      PD3                  Running         False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
222      PD4                  Running         False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
223      PD5                  Running         False        False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...

Notice that the "-Throttle 3" option means that no more than three tests will
run concurrently.  As one finishes then next in line starts up, while
maintaining a maximum of three simultaneous tests.  For example, checking six
seconds later, based on the above six drive test:

PS \\Path\To\> Get-RSJob -Id 218,219,220,221,222,223
or perhaps
218..223 | ForEach { Get-RSJob -Id $_ }

Id       Name                 State           HasMoreData  HasErrors    Command
--       ----                 -----           -----------  ---------    -------
218      PD0                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
219      PD1                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
220      PD2                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
221      PD3                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
222      PD4                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...
223      PD5                  Completed       True         False         & 'C:\Program Files\Seagate\SeaChest...

After all tests are complete you can view the final display output by using the
Receive-RSJob command.  For example, based on the above six drive test:

PS \\Path\To\> Receive-RSJob -Id 218,219,220,221,222,223
or perhaps
218..223 | ForEach { Write-Host "Id" $_; Receive-RSJob -Id $_ }

Example 2:
=========
With four drives testing Short Drive Self Test (DST) it would be:
0,1,4,6 | Start-RSJob -Name {"PD$($_)"} -Throttle 3 -ScriptBlock { & '\\Path\To\SeaChest_Basics.exe' -d PD$_ --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine } | Wait-RSJob -ShowProgress | Receive-RSJob
or perhaps
0,1,4,6 | Start-RSJob -Name {"PD$($_)"} -Throttle 3 -ScriptBlock { & '\\Path\To\SeaChest_Basics.exe' -d PD$_ --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine } | Wait-RSJob -ShowProgress | Get-RSJob

equivalent to starting in parallel:
SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_Basics -d PD1 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_Basics -d PD4 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine
SeaChest_Basics -d PD6 --shortDST --poll --echoCommandLine

The Wait-RSJob command holds up returning to the PowerShell command line until
the jobs are complete (or a timeout is reached).  In addition, an optional
progress bar is selected.  Lastly, when all jobs are complete the Receive-RSJob
command shows the display output for each instance of the SeaChest test.  When
Start-RSJob, Wait-RSJob and Receive-RSJob are pipelined together, the block of
job Id's are automatically passed along to the next PoshRSJob command.
