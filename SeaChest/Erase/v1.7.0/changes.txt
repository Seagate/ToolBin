v0.0.2  21-May-2015  Added --testUnitReady. Improved device discovery.
v0.0.3  12-Aug-2015  Modified some commands to consist of two parts - starting
                     LBA and LBA range count.  Improved device discovery.
                     Corrections to verbose output.
v0.0.3  16-Oct-2015  1_7_0 libraries.  Added enhanced version information.
                     Added -sat12byte to increase compatibility.  Added
                     --SATInfo to compare ATA vs SCSI identification
                     differences.
v1.0.0  02-May-2016  1_9_1 libraries.  Added new verbosity level. Added
                     --onlySeagate restriction.  Added --modelMatch and
                     --onlyFW filters. Added logic change for --overwrite and
                     --trim commands to assume Max LBA (end of the drive) as
                     the range when the erase range is not specified.  Added

                     identify data from the device structure. Fixed continuing
                     on when there was a permission denied error opening a
                     drive. Adjustments to --fastFormat.

                     functions, format polling, endianess detection, buffer
                     size fixes, SAS device statistics, Win32 IOCTL

                     maxLBA keyword.
v1.2.0  01-Sep-2016  1_11_1 libraries updates to various printed message,

v1.3.0  25-Oct-2016  1_11_5 libraries updates improved LaCie  detection, adds
                     SAT Vendor ID, SAT Product ID, and SAT Product Revision to
                     the -i --SATInfo output.
v1.3.1  27-Oct-2016  1_11_6 libraries updates WWN detection.  Added
                     --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
v1.3.1  03-Nov-2016  1_11_7 libraries fixed issue with SAS EPC power mode
                     settings.

                     patterns. Also improved logic when using the various Range
                     commands.
v1.3.2  13-Dec-2016  1_11_10 libraries fixes a problem when using maxLBA without
                     the corresponding command range option, SAS power mode
                     setting, and Sanitize erase patterns.
v1.4.0  23-Feb-2017  1_13_0 libraries adds support for SAS 12.0Gb/s and

                     removed (caused test to abort), use --poll instead. Add
                     --hideLBACounter. New -F, --scanFlags [options: ignoreCSMI

v1.5.0  24-May-2017  1_14_3 libraries. Added "Storage Element Depopulation" if
                     a supported feature.  Adds --showPhysicalElementStatus,
                     --forceSeagateDepop, --removePhysicalElement.
v1.6.0  14-Jun-2017  1_15_0 libraries adds bug fix malformed command line
                     should exit with code = 1; added detection of parallel ATA
                     and SCSI speeds; temperature data on ATA now uses the
                     values from the SCT status log or device statistics log.
                     Bug fix where the "-d all" was not filtering out csmi
                     drives like it is supposed to causing duplicate drives to
                     show up.  Adds the child drive matching options
                     --childModelMatch, --childOnlyFW, and --childNewFW.  Bug
                     fix with --showEraseSupport showing non-ascii characters.
                     Added --showPhysicalElementStatus and
                     --removePhysicalElement.
v1.7.0  14-Jul-2017  1_16_1 libraries adds support for ATA drives that have the
                     Sense Data Reporting feature enabled, changes to how we
                     interpret the completion status from the drive, new Sense
                     Data ASC, ASCQ definitions from SPC5. Adds --Scan (or -S,
                     note the capital S) aggressive system scan.
v1.7.0  27-Jul-2017  1_16_2 libraries enhances Seagate brand detection.
