===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Erase diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Erase is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
efficiently erase data on Seagate disk drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor,
Samsung and LaCie).

NOTE: SeaChest_Erase may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Erase.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

Some of the erase options will require you to enable ATA Trusted Trusted
Computing Group (TCG) commands support for your Linux operating system. Please
see the section below "Enabling TCG Commands In Linux" for information about
this requirement.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

If this is not your drive and the original owner has no claim of ownership to
it or the data stored on it, then you may still be responsible for the data in
your possession.   To protect yourself from potential liability and to protect
the previous owner's privacy, you should remove all data by performing a data
erasure on this drive.

Be very careful because using SeaChest_Erase will cause data loss. Seagate is
not responsible for lost user data.

Important note: Many tests in this tool directly reference storage device data
sectors, also known as Logical Block Addresses (LBA). Test arguments may
require a starting LBA or an LBA range.  The predefined variable 'maxLBA'
refers to the last sector on the drive.  Many older SATA and SAS storage
controllers (also known as Host Bus Adapters [HBA]) have a maximum addressable
limit of 4294967295 [FFFFh] LBAs hard wired into their design.  This equates to
2.1TB using 512 byte sectors.  This also means accessing an LBA beyond the
2.1TB limitation either will result in an error or simply the last readable LBA
(usually LBA 4294967295 [FFFFh]) depending on the actual hardware.  This
limitation can have important consequences.  For example, if you intended to
erase a 4TB drive, then only the first 2TB will actually get erased (or maybe
even twice!) and the last 2TB will remain untouched.  You should carefully
evaluate your system hardware to understand if your storage controllers provide
support for greater than 2.1TB.

Usage
=====
        SeaChest_Erase [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples
========
        SeaChest_Erase --scan
        SeaChest_Erase -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_Erase --device /dev/sg1 --sanitize info

Utility arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with logical
                /dev/sg? assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
                numbers. If your device is not listed on a scan immediately
                after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example: -d /dev/sg5

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add--usbChildInfo to
                display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --displayLBA [LBA | maxLBA]
                This option will read and display the contents of the specified
                LBA to the screen. The display format is hexadecimal with an
                ASCII translation on the side (when available).  The predefined
                text string "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to
                indicate the last sector on the drive instead of the specific
                LBA number.

        --showEraseSupport
                This option checks the drive to determine which methods of data
                erasure are supported and lists them, from fastest to slowest.
                Gives overwrite erase time estimate.

        --poll
                Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
                until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
                command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
                and the final test result.  Full drive procedures will take a
                very long time.  Used with --sanitize, --secureErase (SATA),
                --writeSame (SATA), or --formatUnit (SAS).

        --progress [sanitize, format]
                Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default)
                specify a test to check progress. The progress counts up from
                0% to 100%.

        --disableATASecurityPW [SeaChest | ASCIIPW] [user | master]
                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If a drive
                lost power during an ATA Security Erase in SeaChest, then using
                the option "SeaChest" with 'user' will remove the temporary
                password set by the utility. To disable a password set by a
                BIOS, the BIOS must have set the password in ASCII. A BIOS may
                choose to hash the password typed in the configuration however
                it chooses and this utility has no idea how to match what the
                BIOS has done so it may not always work to remove a password
                set by something other than this utility.  Some commands like
                --scan and --deviceInfo and will still run on a locked drive.

                Note: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        --showPhysicalElementStatus
                Use this option to see the status/health of the storage
                elements inside a drive. Use the element # shown with the
                --removePhysicalElement option to remove that storage element
                from use. This option can also be used to see if a depopulation
                is still in progress or if it has completed.  See the section
                below 'Interpreting Head Health and Status' for more
                information.

        --forceSeagateDepop (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to force using Seagate's vendor unique method
                of seeing and removing storage elements from use. This is a
                legacy method and the default mode is to use the ACS4 or SBC4
                methods when available.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest_Erase in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest_Erase version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --hideLBACounter
                Use this option to supress the output from options that show
                LBA counters without turning off all output to the screen.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --hours [hours]
                Use this option to specify a time in hours for a timed
                operation to run.

        --minutes [minutes]
                Use this option to specify a time in minutes for a timed
                operation to run.

        --seconds [seconds]
                Use this option to specify a time in seconds for a timed
                operation to run.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        --confirm I-understand-this-command-will-erase ... etc

        --performQuickestErase (Seagate Only)
                This option checks the drive to determine which methods of data
                erasure are supported and determines which is the quickest to
                erase ALL data on the drive. It then starts the quickest erase.
                Combine this option with the --poll option to enable polling
                for progress on the fastest erase.  See also --showEraseSupport.

                Note 1: Some erase methods require polling and will have polling
                enabled by default.

                Note 2: If revertSP is the fastest, it will not be started
                since the drive PSID must be passed in on the command line.

                Note 3: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        --sanitize [info | blockerase | cryptoerase | overwrite | freezelock |
                    antifreezelock]
                Use the info argument to show supported sanitize operations.
                Optionally, use blockerase, cryptoerase, or overwrite to start
                a sanitize operation.

                Example:--sanitize info
                Example:--sanitize blockerase

                * blockerase on some solid state drives (SSD) is very fast at
                less than one (1) second, while on other SSDs it can take
                longer than 30 seconds. It performs a physical low level block
                erase operation on all current, past and potential user data
                making previous data irretrievable.

                * cryptoerase is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless.

                * overwrite physically overwrites all current, past and
                potential user data. The ATA specification gives overwrite the
                option to set a user defined pattern and multiple passes.
                SeaChest_Erase will use zeros (0) and one pass.

                Overwrite on hard disk drives (HDD) takes a very long time to
                complete at approximately three (3) hours per TeraByte. Once
                this command starts it must finish the overwrite erase before
                normal use of the drive is returned. Even if a power reset is
                performed during overwrite erase the drive will continue from
                where it was stopped until it reaches the end of the of
                erasure. Automatic sector reallocation (repair) is permitted
                during the operation of this function.

                The optional --poll argument does not return to the command
                prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%) and the
                final test result. Otherwise, the Sanitize command begins and
                immediately returns to the command prompt.  Use the --progress
                sanitize command to check on the completion percentage (%) and
                test result.

                * freezelock is a command to block processing of sanitize
                operations until a power cycle is performed on a device. It is
                only available on ATA drives. Once this command has been sent,
                the freezelock status becomes immediate and cannot be cleared
                until the drive has been powered off. All sanitize commands,
                except a sanitize status will be aborted.

                * antifreezelock is a command which is designed to block a
                freezelock command from locking out the sanitize feature set.
                It is only available on ATA drives that support the ACS3, or
                higher specification.

        --secureErase [normal | enhanced]          (SATA only)
                Use the normal or enhanced argument to start an ATA security
                erase on a device.

                ATA Security Erase on standard drives (non-SED) takes a very
                long time to complete at approximately three (3) hours per
                TeraByte. Self Encrypting Drives (SED) may run an quick
                cryptographic erase by changing the drive's encryption keys.
                The industry standard command ATA Security Erase begins by
                locking the drive with a temporary password which is cleared at
                the end of the erasure. Do not run this command unless you have
                ample time to allow it to run through to the end. If the
                procedure is interrupted prior to completion, then the drive
                will remain in a locked state and you must manually restart it
                from the beginning. The temporary password to unlock the drive
                is "SeaChest", plain ASCII letters without the quotes.  If the
                drive reports that it is freezelocked, then this is usually put
                on by a BIOS command at startup.  After the operating system is
                finished booting you can try removing the power to just the
                hard drive.  This should allow it to restart without the
                freezelock command.

                * normal writes binary zeros (0) to all user data areas.

                * enhanced writes binary zeros (0) to all user data areas,
                including sectors that are no longer in use due to
                reallocation. Not all drives support the enhanced mode. For
                some models (ISE enabled), enhanced mode erase can take seconds
                because it uses crypto erase internally.

                Note: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        --overwrite [starting LBA | maxLBA]
                Use this option to start an overwrite erase at the specified
                starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to mean the beginning
                of the drive.  The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without
                quotes) may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive
                instead of the specific LBA number.  The overwrite data pattern
                will be all zeros (0000... etc) for the specified range.  You
                must combine this option with either the --overwriteRange to
                set the range count of the erasure, or the time settings
                (--minutes, etc. see above).

                Example: --overwrite 0 --overwriteRange 1000000
                         --overwrite 0 --hours 1 --minutes 30

                Important: If the end of the drive is reached before the time
                is up, the operation will continue at the beginning of the
                drive until the specified time is finished.  This means your
                starting LBA may not be the lowest LBA erased.  Use --overwrite
                and --overwriteRange together instead for more control of the
                starting and ending LBAs.  This test always issues write
                commands to the drive. No TRIM or UNMAP commands are used
                during this operation.

                Note: This erase may be used on HDD (hard disk drive) or SSD
                (solid state disk) devices, although not advised for SSD
                because it impacts endurance life due to abnormal write
                activity.

        --overwriteRange [LBA count]
                Use with the --overwrite option to specify a range of LBAs to
                erase on the selected drive.  If the starting LBA and the range
                count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of the drive)
                then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this command is
                omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the test will
                end at the MaxLBA.

        --trim [starting LBA | maxLBA]         (SATA only)
        --unmap [starting LBA | maxLBA]        (SAS only)
                Use this option to start a TRIM (SATA) or UNMAP (SAS) operation
                at the specified starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to
                mean the beginning of the drive.  The predefined text string
                "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to indicate the last
                sector on the drive instead of the specific LBA number.  These
                commands are common on SSD devices and less common on HDDs.
                You must combine this option with the corresponding --trimRange
                or --unmapRange to set the range of the operation.

        --trimRange [LBA count]         (SATA only)
        --unmapRange [LBA count]        (SAS only)
                Use one of these options to specify a range of LBAs to TRIM or
                UNMAP on a drive. A starting point must be specified with the
                corresponding --trim or --unmap option.  If the starting LBA
                and the range count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of
                the drive) then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this
                command is omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the
                test will end at the MaxLBA.

        --writeSame [starting LBA | maxLBA]
                Use this option to start a WRITE SAME erase at the specified
                starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to mean the beginning
                of the drive.  The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without
                quotes) may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive
                instead of the specific LBA number.  The Write Same data
                pattern will be all zeros (0000... etc) for the specified
                range.  You must combine this option with the --writeSameRange
                to set the range of the erasure.

                On SCSI devices, this uses the writesame16 command. On ATA
                devices, this uses the SCT writesame feature.

                Note: For SATA drives, adding the --poll option will cause this
                operation to poll for progress until complete. This is not
                available on SAS and SCSI drives because SCSI drives do not
                report the progress on a Write Same operation.

        --writeSameRange [LBA count]
                Use with the --writeSame option to specify a range of LBAs to
                erase on the selected drive.  If the starting LBA and the range
                count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of the drive)
                then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this command is
                omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the test will
                end at the MaxLBA.

        --revert
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification Revert on a Self Encrypting
                Drive (SED). This operation is only available on Seagate TCG
                Opal drives. Seagate SED drives are marked on the label with
                the words "Seagate Secure".  No all Seagate SED drives are TCG
                Opal compliant.

                In order to complete this operation, the lockingSP must not be
                activated, as this option will activate it in order to perform
                the revert. The value of SID, must also be the value of MSID as
                this operation must authenticate as SID using the value of
                MSID. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults. If this operation fails, use
                --revertSP instead.

                Note: See the section below "Enabling TCG Commands In Linux".

        --revertSP DrivePSID
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification revertSP on a Self
                Encrypting Drive (SED). This operation is available on all
                Seagate SED drives which are marked on the label with the words
                "Seagate Secure".

                The PSID (Physical Security IDentification number) is a
                32-digit number & capital letter sequence printed on the label.
                There is no electronic query for this number, therefore the
                drive must be removed in order to read the PSID number.  Many
                drives have a PSID code on the label but are NOT marked as
                "Seagate Secure"; these drives do not support revertSP
                cryptographic erase.

                Enter the PSID without spaces. FIVE attempts are allowed before
                a power cycle is required. It can also be read by 2D barcode
                reader. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults.

                Example: --revertSP 123ALL32DIGITS123ALL32DIGITS123A

                Note: See the section below "Enabling TCG Commands In Linux".

        --formatUnit [current | new sector size]    (SAS Only) (Seagate Only)
                This option will start a format unit operation on a SAS drive
                Use "current" to perform a format unit operation with the
                Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector
                size to use upon format completion.

                Valid sector sizes are given by the --showSupportedSectorSizes
                command (see above) or  listed in the device Product Manual.
                This command will erase all data on the drive. The security
                initialize feature is not used and protection information will
                not be set. Combine this option with --poll or --progress to
                check for completion status until the format is complete.

                Warning: Once a Format Unit command is started it must be
                allowed to finish in order to calculate the total number of
                logical blocks (LBAs) at the finish.  If the sector size has
                changed then there will be a corresponding change to the total
                number of LBAs. If a device stops a Format Unit before it
                completes then the device will report a "Corrupted Format"
                sense code, "03-31".  Restart the format and allow it to finish
                to correct this error.

        --fastFormat [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)
                You must use this option with the --formatUnit option to run a
                fast format. Available fast format modes:
                    0 - This is a standard format unit command. All logical
                        blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a
                        very long time.
                    1 - This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
                        data in the physical sector. This option can be used to
                        quickly change the the logical sector size between 5xx
                        emulation and 4xxx native logical block sizes.
                        Resulting LBA (sector) count is either /8 or *8 the
                        current Read Capacity, depending on the direction of
                        the conversion.  The media may be readable, but data
                        may be unspecified or may return errors on read access
                        according to it's error processing algorithms.
                    2 - This is a fast format unit command that can change the
                        logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be
                        read accessible until a write has been performed to
                        the media.

                Example: --formatUnit 512 --fastFormat 1 --confirm I-... etc
                Example: --formatUnit 4096 --fastFormat 1 --confirm I-... etc

        --pattern [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue |
             file:filename]
                Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
                operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs or
                the whole drive.

                * repeat - without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
                hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This pattern
                will be repeated until it fills the logical size of the LBA.
                i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
                Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
                      unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be
                      given for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or
                      0000FFFFh

                * random - the entire logical sector size will be filled with
                random bytes. This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
                desired range.

                * increment - enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
                this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.

                * file - user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
                will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector
                size.
                Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
                Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
                        local directory.
                Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit
                        pattern. The file option will get truncated to a 32bit
                        pattern for SATA products.

        --removePhysicalElement [element #] (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to remove a storage element from use on a
                drive. When this is done, the drive will erase all user data
                and lower the capacity to a new point where the drive is still
                usable without the provided element #. Use the
                --showPhysicalElementStatus option to see the status of the
                depopulation operation.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

Note: See the section below "Enabling TCG Commands In Linux".

First, run the SeaChest_Erase -s option to determine what /dev/sg? device handle
assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you other
details about the drive including the current firmware revision. Like this:

Vendor     Handle       Model Number       Serial Number     FwRev
ATA        /dev/sg0     ST94813AS          3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    /dev/sg1     ST1000NM0011       ZAA15VAS          SN03

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the sg device handle (-d, --device).

For example, SeaChest_Erase -d /dev/sg1 --deviceInfo

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d /dev/sg# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example,
SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -d /dev/sg3 -i runs identify on these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to "I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time" or
"I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data".

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

When drives are reported Security "Frozen" by SeaChest
------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Your system or the SeaChest software may report that a SATA password
cannot be changed because it is "frozen". Many systems BIOS will automatically
set the ATA SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command on all SATA drives at start up. The
SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command prevents changes to all Security states until a
following power-on reset or hardware reset. The purpose of the SECURITY FREEZE
LOCK command is to prevent password setting attacks on the security system.

The SeaChest --deviceInfo command will display something similar to this: "ATA
Security Information: Supported, Frozen". To disable Freeze Lock, first check
your BIOS SATA disk options to control the setting at start up. Otherwise, you
might pause the boot up shortly after powering on the system and then
temporarily remove the power to the security frozen drive (let it completely
spin down). When the power is back on the drive it will start without being
frozen.

Windows systems may also decide not to recognize the drive if it is ATA
Security Locked and it will not be listed by the SeaChest --scan command.  If
the drive remains undetected in Windows, your alternative is to make a bootable
USB flash drive and run SeaChest_Erase from the Linux operating system.

Interpreting Head Health and Status
-----------------------------------
Beginning in 2016, some Seagate nearline drives started to support the
Remanufacture command set which allows a disk drive with a manageable
read/write head problem to remain in service at a reduced capacity by
"depopulating" the head element.  You can check if a drive supports the
Remanufacture command set by running --deviceInfo and looking for 'Storage
Element Depopulation' in the list of supported features.  (Not to be confused
with 'SATA Rebuild Assist' which is a feature used to rebuild RAID systems.)

A drive failure (due to a head problem) that is easily removed from the system
is replaced with a spare drive.  A drive that is nearly inaccessible may make
sense to remain in the system at a reliable lesser capacity by depopulating the
problem head.

If supported by the drive, the --showPhysicalElementStatus command will display
a simple table showing head number, type, health, and status.

The Health level is represented like a percentage, 0-100.  0 is perfectly
healthy, 100 = at manufacturer's limit, above this to 207 is above the
manufacturer's limit. A report of 254 means a depopulate is in progress.

The Status levels are active, in limit, degraded, truncated, truncate failed.

If a drive head has developed isolated, degraded performance, and does not
affect any other reliability in the system, then the head can be removed from
service. A drive with seven platters and fourteen heads would lose 1/14th of
its storage capacity, or ~7%.  Likewise, a four head drive would lose 25%.

If a drive is reported as "degraded" by --showPhysicalElementStatus then it can
be depopulated using the --removePhysicalElement command.  When a head is
depopulated the drive must perform a complete full pack write; this is
obviously data destructive and takes a very long time to complete.

When disk drives are built the post assembly factory process includes media
scanning, any defects mapping, defining sector sizes, and establishing system,
cache and data zones.  This activity is generically known as a low-level
format.  During head depopulation (i.e. removing a physical element) the drive
performs a kind of 'mid-level format' using Sanitize Overwrite which has the
unique behavior that once started it must finish.  If power is interrupted
during a Sanitize Overwrite it will pick up again where it left off when power
returns.

==============================
Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
==============================
Abstract
--------
The SeaChest_Erase --revert and --revertSP commands require specific support be
enabled in the Linux kernel.  This document describes the process to enable
support for sending ATA Trusted Trusted Computing Group (TCG) commands in
Linux. The focus is on how to do this through Ubuntu Linux 14.04LTS, however,
the process should apply to other Linux’s as well although others may vary
slightly.

Modifying The GRUB Configuration File (Ubuntu example used)
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to make the change to allow TCG commands persist across reboots, you
must modify the kernel boot parameters. In Ubuntu, this is accomplished by
modifying the GRUB 2 configuration file. This section references the Grub2
configuration documentation from the Ubuntu Community:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup#Configuring_GRUB_2

Follow these steps to perform this modification in Ubuntu (other Linux’s may be
similar).

1. You must modify the file /etc/default/grub. You can do this by running "sudo
gedit /etc/default/grub"

2. Once this file is open in the editor of your choice, add
"libata.allow_tpm=1" to the line  that begins with "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT"
(or which ever line in grub is the one you use to boot your kernel, but this is
the default).

3. Close your editor

4. Run the command "sudo update-grub" to apply your changes to the grub boot
configuration (the file modified in these steps is a config file for the config
file).

5. Restart your computer to make this active

Temporarily Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
------------------------------------------
You can temporarily enable TCG commands without modifying the kernel boot
parameters. This can be accomplished by modifying the libata parameters file.
Below is a sample script that can be run to do this.

Sample Script:

cd /sys/module/libata/parameters
sudo chmod 644 allow_tpm
echo 1 | sudo dd of=./allow_tpm
sudo chmod 444 allow_tpm

Tiny Core - Enabling TCG Commands
------------------------------------------
Follow these steps to enable TCG commands on a Tiny Core bootable USB flash
drive.

1. Leave the USB flash drive in after you run the Windows-based USB boot maker
tool.

2. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/boot/syslinux.cfg and in there, add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the append line with the other kernel boot parameters.

3. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/EFI/boot/refind.conf and add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the options line with the other kernel boot parameters

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
Remember that Linux file names and command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Display a file listing with the Linux command: ls -lah

The tool will require root privileges to run using either sudo or su commands.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

A dot slash is a dot followed immediately by a forward slash (./). It is used
in Linux to execute a compiled program in the current directory when it is not
a built-in command or found in your path.

For example, ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll
or, sudo ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

Shut down the files system and remove the power with the command:
poweroff

See previous screen history with the key combination:
Shift+PgUp or Shift+PgDn

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.
For example,
SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck | tee -a mySeaChestLog.txt

Display a log or text file with the Linux "less" command: less myfile.log
Press the letter q to quit displaying the file.  Similarly, you can easily
read the Seagate License agreement by piping the output to the less
command with SeaChest --license |less

Display a list of sg (SCSI generic) devices with the command:
cat /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/model
or
ls /dev/sg*

sg devices include the following interfaces: SATA, USB, SCSI (SCSI, SAS and FC)

Add the command word 'time' on the same command line before the SeaChest
command to see how much time it takes to run a test.
For example, time ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

When drives are not detected by SeaChest
----------------------------------------
The problem is that the sg driver isn't loaded on the system on boot.  You can
test if it is loaded by doing "ls /dev/sg*" and see if anything shows up. If
nothing shows up then the SG driver is missing (which is required by SeaChest
to issue commands).

You need to do "modprobe sg" as root to load the sg module (since it wasn't
compiled into the kernel), then you will get sg devices that we can scan and
find. Once you run the modprobe command and sg is successfully loaded, then you
can re-run "ls /dev/sg*" and see SG device nodes. SeaChest tools should then be
able to find devices once again.

How to control the amount of runtime kernel messages
----------------------------------------------------
When testing more drives than a system can hold, careful use of host adapters
and hot-plugging batches of drives (but never to direct motherboard
connections!) can help speed the process.  The Linux operating system will
display various system error messages, or none, when storage devices are
powered down and exchanged with the next drives.  The amount of information
contained in the OS error messages can be reviewed using the Linux utility
command "sysctl kernel.printk".  The default setting is defined by the
particular distro.  Tiny Core Linux, for example may set "4 4 1 7".  To hide
hot-plugging messages try "3 4 1 7", to increase the messaging to include
device details like model numbers try "6 4 1 7".  The command to set is 'sudo
sysctl -w kernel.printk="6 4 1 7"'.  See man sysctl - "configure kernel
parameters at runtime" for more.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerChoice - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
