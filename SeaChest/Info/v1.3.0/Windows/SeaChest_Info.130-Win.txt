Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Info diagnostic software.

Disk drives are constantly monitoring and analyzing their own performance,
integrity and environment.  The current state of this technology is the result
of more than 20 years of innovative Seagate engineering focused on self-testing.

With the backing of personal computer manufacturers, the disk drive industry
adopted an analysis system in the 1990's called Self Monitoring Analysis and
Reporting Technology, or SMART. The idea then and today is to predict a failure
before it happens. Various attributes are being monitored and measured against
certain threshold limits. If any one attribute exceeds a threshold then a
general SATA SMART Status test will change from Pass to Fail.

Many computers automatically check SATA SMART Status when they start up which is
when most people become aware of the issue. If still under warranty, then SMART
Status FAIL is a valid condition for warranty replacement.

You can use SeaChest_Basics or SeaChest_SMART software with --smartCheck to
test the SATA SMART status of the drive.

When a SMART Status test has a FAIL it is extremely important that you back up
all of your important data. SMART Status FAIL is a near-term prediction of
drive failure and the drive usually functions like normal. Unfortunately, there
is no way to specifically predict when the failure will occur, so your best
response is to back up your data as soon as possible.

SMART attributes are also supplemented by SATA Device Statistics Notification
(DSN) feature set, including a set of Device Statistics Notifications log
pages.  This data provides further insight into a drive's performance and can
be used to help measure its usage and potentially identify problem areas of
concern.

Likewise, SAS SCSI and FibreChannel interface products collect ongoing
performance data and save this information in many different "vital data" and
"log" pages, also call Vital Product Data (VPD). This data is similar and
overlaps most of the same data collection categories as the SATA interface.

SeaChest does not interpret attributes or thresholds.  As a practical matter,
the technology supporting SMART is constantly being improved.  Each new design
incorporates improvements that increase the accuracy of the SMART prediction.
As a matter of policy, Seagate does not publish attributes and thresholds.
Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your Seagate storage
product. It includes several tests that will examine the physical media on your
Seagate, Samsung or Maxtor disk drive.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
SeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Usage
=====
        SeaChest_Info [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples
========
        SeaChest_Info --scan
        SeaChest_Info -d PD0 -i
        SeaChest_Info -d PD1 --shortDST --poll

Utility arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the PD physical device handle (target drive) on which to
                perform an operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints'
                for information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example: -d PD0, or -d PD3 (case sensitive).

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --smartAttributes [raw | analyzed]
                The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
                Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
                vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
                always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
                used to determine a warranty return. Use the --smartCheck
                command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been
                tripped. Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART
                attributes.

        --deviceStatistics
                Use this option to display the device statistics reported by
                the device. On SATA, this uses the Device Statistics log, and
                the notifications log (if DSN feature is supported) to display
                these statistics. On SAS, various log pages are read to collect
                a bunch of equivalent reported parameter information.

        --csmiInfo
                Use this option to show some information reported by the CSMI
                compliant driver. This includes driver information, controller
                information, PHY information, SAS address, and SATA signature
                as they were reported by the driver. This information can be
                useful when troubleshooting CSMI system/driver compatibility
                issues.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the SeaChest -s option to determine what physical device assignment
lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you other details about
the drive including the current firmware revision. Like this:

Vendor     Handle   Model Number        Serial Number     FwRev
IDE        PD0      ST94813AS           3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    PD1      ST1000NM0011        ZAA15VAS          SN03

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the physical device handle (-d, --device).

For example, SeaChest_Info -d PD2 --shortDST poll

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
SeaChest_Info -d PD0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d PD# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example,
SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then SeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to "I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time" or
"I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data".

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\SeaChest_Info --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Setup for Windows
-----------------
The SeaChest Utilities Setup places all of the files at "C:\Program
Files\Seagate\SeaChest" and adds an icon on the Desktop.  Clicking the icon
will open a Windows command prompt in Administrator mode at this location.
From there you will need to type the full command line for the tool and device
and options to run the test you require.  See the various SeaChest Help
documentation for descriptions and examples of the various commands.

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual SeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just clicking
on the file name. If started that way, the SeaChest utility will briefly show a
black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when trying to run it
from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the SeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

SATA SSD SMART Attributes example.

The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes. Some attributes
are industry standard and most others are vendor unique. Most attributes are
informational and not used to determine a warranty return. Use the --smartCheck
command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been tripped.

Reminder: Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest FormatUnit - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerChoice - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
