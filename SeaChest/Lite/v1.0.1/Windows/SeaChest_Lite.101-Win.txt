Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest Lite diagnostic software.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest Lite.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your Seagate storage
product. It also includes a command to change the default sector size on
supported drive models.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like changing the default sector
size) are limited to Seagate disk drives. Be careful using SeaChest because
some of the features, like the data erasure options, will cause data loss.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

If you need additional diagnostics for your Seagate family drive, please see
the section below 'About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics'.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Important note: Many tests in this tool directly reference storage device data
sectors, also known as Logical Block Addresses (LBA). Test arguments may
require a starting LBA or an LBA range.  The predefined variable 'maxLBA'
refers to the last sector on the drive.  Many older SATA and SAS storage
controllers (also known as Host Bus Adapters [HBA]) have a maximum addressable
limit of 4294967295 [FFFFh] LBAs hard wired into their design.  This equates to
2.1TB using 512 byte sectors.  This also means accessing an LBA beyond the
2.1TB limitation either will result in an error or simply the last readable LBA
(usually LBA 4294967295 [FFFFh]) depending on the actual hardware.  This
limitation can have important consequences.  For example, if you intended to
erase a 4TB drive, then only the first 2TB will actually get erased (or maybe
even twice!) and the last 2TB will remain untouched.  You should carefully
evaluate your system hardware to understand if your storage controllers provide
support for greater than 2.1TB.

NOTE: Windows severely restricts downloading firmware to SATA drives.  Please
see the section below "Windows Restrictions Over SATA Firmware Downloads".
SeaChest_Lite may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

Usage
=====
        SeaChest_Lite [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples
========
        SeaChest_Lite --scan
        SeaChest_Lite -d PD0 -i
        SeaChest_Lite -d PD1 --shortDST --poll

Utility arguments
=================
        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the PD physical device handle (target drive) on which to
                perform an operation.

                Example: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        --downloadFW [fwfilename]    (Seagate Only)
                Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
                Seagate authorized firmware data files which are designated for
                the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
                a device and or its data. You may specify the path if the
                firmware data file is in a different location. This option will
                use segmented download by default.

        --shortDST
                Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take
                up to 2 minutes to complete.  Use with the --poll argument to
                let SeaChest check for progress and print it to the screen
                until complete.  If the --poll argument is not used then the
                test begins and immediately returns to the command prompt.  Use
                the --progress DST command to check on the completion
                percentage (%) and test result. The poll argument does not
                return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion
                percentages (%) until the final test result.

                Note: Use --progress DST to see details about the last DST
                      run on the drive.

        --poll
                Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
                until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
                command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
                and the final test result.Used with --shortDST.

        --progress [DST]
                Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default).
                The progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

        --showSupportedSectorSizes
                This option will show the supported sector sizes of a device if
                it reports them. These can be used to change the sector size or
                used with a format unit operation. On SAS, this is the
                supported block lengths and protection types VPD page. (SBC4
                and later) On SATA, this is the sector configuration log. (ACS4
                and later) If the device does not report supported sector
                sizes, please consult your product manual.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        --setSectorSize [new sector size]       (Seagate Only)
                This option is only available for drives that support sector
                size changes. On SATA Drives, the Set Sector Configuration
                command must be supported. On SAS Drives, Fast Format must be
                supported. Use the --showSupportedSectorSizes option to see the
                sector sizes the drive reports supporting. If this option
                doesn't list anything, please consult your product manual.

                This option can be used to quickly change the the logical
                sector size between 5xx emulation and 4xxx native logical block
                sizes, usually 512 and 4096. Resulting LBA (sector) count is
                either /8 or *8 the current Read Capacity or Identify,
                depending on the direction of the conversion.  The conversion
                between logical sector sizes can take a few minutes.  Do not
                interrupt this operation.  (See the help topic below: About
                FastFormat)

        --confirm I-understand-this-command-will-erase ... etc

================
Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the SeaChest -s option to determine what physical device assignment
lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you other details about
the drive including the current firmware revision. Like this:

Vendor     Handle   Model Number        Serial Number     FwRev
IDE        PD0      ST94813AS           3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    PD1      ST1000NM0011        ZAA15VAS          SN03

You can use SeaChest -s --onlySeagate to limit the display to just Seagate.

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the physical device handle (-d, --device).

For example, SeaChest -d PD2 --shortDST --poll

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
SeaChest_Lite -d PD0 -i --shortDST --poll runs both identify and the
drive self test.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d PD# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example,
SeaChest_Lite -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate and --modelMatch filters.

All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then SeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to "I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time" or
"I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data".

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

Windows Restrictions Over SATA Firmware Downloads
-------------------------------------------------
You should not attempt downloading firmware to a SATA disk drive in the Windows
operating system unless the drive supports the 'deferred' mode.  You define the
mode with the SeaChest command line option '--downloadMode deferred'.  If the
drive does not support deferred mode then the command will be aborted.  Windows
may not be so restrictive on secondary, non-boot SATA drives or SATA drives
attached to host bus adapters (HBAs, controllers, USB, etc).

If you force a primary SATA boot drive to download firmware in Windows using a
different --downloadMode setting, then the result will likely be a BSOD (blue
screen of death) system crash.  This is because the legacy SATA firmware
download modes require the drive to spin down and then back up and the
momentary disappearance of the drive causes the operating system to crash.
Windows is actually protecting the system when it thinks the drive has stopped
responding (see wikis about Ring 0 Protection).

The 'deferred' mode does not spin down the drive.  Instead, the drive waits for
a future reboot of the system and self-activates the firmware at that time.
Other operating systems may utilize the SeaChest --activateFW command to
trigger the switch to the new firmware version.

================
About FastFormat
================
A FastFormat (quickly changing the logical sector size) may take a few minutes
for the process to complete. The disk activity LED may show activity during the
conversion.  The larger the drive, the longer it takes.

NOTE: Operating systems do a device discovery during start up and set various
parameters, like total sectors and sector size, into the storage device
descriptions. The logical sector size times the number or logical sectors
defines the drive capacity.  You should expect to see OS I/O errors if you
change the logical sector size on a drive and then perform read or write
operations before the OS has updated its storage device descriptions.  Some
operating systems will throw an error after accessing a drive that has just run
a FastFormat but during its error recovery routines it may re-discover the
device parameters and update the system logs.  A system restart, however, is
the most reliable way to refresh the storage device descriptions.

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Setup for Windows
-----------------
The SeaChest Utilities Setup places all of the files at "C:\Program
Files\Seagate\SeaChest" and adds an icon on the Desktop.  Clicking the icon
will open a Windows command prompt in Administrator mode at this location.
From there you will need to type the full command line for the tool and device
and options to run the test you require.  See the various SeaChest Help
documentation for descriptions and examples of the various commands.

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual SeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just clicking
on the file name. If started that way, the SeaChest utility will briefly show a
black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when trying to run it
from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the SeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerChoice - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

=================================
Support and Open Source Statement

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
