===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest Basics diagnostic software.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest Basics.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your Seagate storage
product. It includes several tests that will examine the physical media on your
Seagate, Samsung or Maxtor disk drive.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
SeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Important note: Many tests in this tool directly reference storage device data
sectors, also known as Logical Block Addresses (LBA). Test arguments may
require a starting LBA or an LBA range.  The predefined variable 'maxLBA'
refers to the last sector on the drive.  Many older SATA and SAS storage
controllers (also known as Host Bus Adapters [HBA]) have a maximum addressable
limit of 4294967295 [FFFFh] LBAs hard wired into their design.  This equates to
2.1TB using 512 byte sectors.  This also means accessing an LBA beyond the
2.1TB limitation either will result in an error or simply the last readable LBA
(usually LBA 4294967295 [FFFFh]) depending on the actual hardware.  This
limitation can have important consequences.  For example, if you intended to
erase a 4TB drive, then only the first 2TB will actually get erased (or maybe
even twice!) and the last 2TB will remain untouched.  You should carefully
evaluate your system hardware to understand if your storage controllers provide
support for greater than 2.1TB.

NOTE: Windows severely restricts downloading firmware to SATA drives.  Please
see the section below "Windows Restrictions Over SATA Firmware Downloads".
SeaChest_Basics may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

=============
        SeaChest_Basics [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_Basics --scan
        SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg1 --shortDST --poll

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_Basics [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_Basics --scan
        SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -i
        SeaChest_Basics -d PD1 --shortDST --poll

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --displayLBA [LBA | maxLBA]
                This option will read and display the contents of the specified
                LBA to the screen. The display format is hexadecimal with an
                ASCII translation on the side (when available).  The predefined
                text string "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to
                indicate the last sector on the drive instead of the specific
                LBA number.

        --poll
                Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
                until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
                command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
                and the final test result.  Full drive procedures will take a
                very long time.  Used with --shortDST and --longDST.

        --shortDST
                Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take
                up to 2 minutes to complete.  Use with the --poll argument to
                let SeaChest check for progress and print it to the screen
                until complete.  If the --poll argument is not used then the
                test begins and immediately returns to the command prompt.  Use
                the --progress DST command to check on the completion
                percentage (%) and test result. The poll argument does not
                return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion
                percentages (%) until the final test result.

                Note: Use --progress DST to see details about the last DST
                      run on the drive.

        --progress [DST]
                Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default)
                specify a test with: DST or sanitize to check progress. The
                progress counts up from 0% to 100%.

        --abortDST
                Abort a diagnostic Drive Self Test that is in progress.

        --smartCheck
                Perform a SMART check on a device to see if any internal
                thresholds have been tripped or if the drive is still operating
                within specification.

        --downloadFW [firmware filename]    (Seagate Only)
                Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
                Seagate authorized firmware data files which are designated for
                the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
                a device and or its data. You may specify the path (without
                spaces) if the firmware data file is in a different location.
                This option will use segmented download by default. Use the
                --downloadMode option to specify a different download mode.

                Please see the section below "Windows Restrictions Over SATA
                Firmware Downloads".

        --downloadMode [full | segmented | deferred]    (Seagate Only)
                Use this command along with the --downloadFW option to set the
                firmware download mode.

                Supported Modes:
                     full      - Performs a download in one large transfer to
                                 the device.
                     segmented - Downloads the firmware in multiple segments to
                                 the device. (Most compatible)
                     deferred  - Performs a segmented download to the device,
                                 but does not activate the new firmware until a
                                 power cycle or activate command is sent. Drives
                                 with this feature are not common. See
                                 --activateFW.

                Note: See the --modelMatch and --onlyFW utility options which
                may assist in creating commands to update multiple similar
                drives.

        --activateFW     (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was
                sent to the drive using a deferred download command. This will
                immediately activate the new code on the drive. You can use
                this along with a --downloadFW and --downloadMode to
                automatically issue the activate command after the deferred
                download has completed.

        --setMaxLBA [newMaxLBA | maxLBA]
                Set the max accessible address of your drive to any value less
                than the device's default native size. A power cycle is
                required after this command before resetting or setting a new
                max LBA. The final capacity will depend on the logical sector
                size.  If the Logical Block Address (LBA) is set to 1953125 and
                the sector size is 512, then the capacity is 1,000,000,000
                bytes. If the logical sector size is 4096, then the capacity is
                8,000,000,000 bytes.  If the logical sector size is 512 but the
                physical sector size is 4096 (called Advanced Format), then
                normal practice is to pick an LBA value which is divisible by
                8. Use the -i, --deviceInfo to show logical and physical sector
                sizes.  The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without quotes)
                may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive,
                otherwise see --restoreMaxLBA.

        --restoreMaxLBA
                Restore the max accessible address of your drive to its native
                size. A power cycle is required after this command before
                setting a new max LBA.

        --checkPowerMode
                Get the current power mode of a drive. On SCSI devices, this
                will only work if the drive has transitioned from active state
                to another state.  While the popular /dev/sd? device handles
                can be used in most cases, the --checkPowerMode command with
                /dev/sd causes the drive to wake up if it is in a reduced power
                state.  Use /dev/sg device handles to avoid this effect.

        --spinDown
                Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby
                Immediate for SATA, or standby_z for SAS. Use this before
                moving a hard disk drive. The drive will spin back up if the
                operating system selects the drive. This means that an active
                drive will not stay spun down.

                In the case of SSD devices, the drive will flush the temporary
                caches and prepare for shutdown.

        --phySpeed [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5] (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to change the PHY speed to a new maximum value.
                This change persists over power cycles and resets. On SAS, this
                option will set all phys to the specified speed unless the
                --sasPhy option is given to select a specific phy.

                0 - allow full negotiation (default drive behavior)
                1 - allow negotiation up to 1.5Gb/s
                2 - allow negotiation up to 3.0Gb/s
                3 - allow negotiation up to 6.0Gb/s
                4 - allow negotiation up to 12.0Gb/s (SAS Only)
                5 - allow negotiation up to 22.5Gb/s (SAS Only)

        --readLookAhead [info | enable | disable]
                Use this option to enable or disable read look-ahead support on
                a drive.  Use the "info" argument to get the current status of
                the read look ahead feature.  This change is not preserved over
                power cycles.

        --writeCache [info | enable | disable]
                Use this option to enable or disable write cache support on a
                drive.  Use the "info" argument to get the current status of
                the write cache feature.  This change is not preserved over
                power cycles.

        SATA Only:
        =========
        --smartAttributes [raw | analyzed]      (SATA Only)
                The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
                Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
                vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
                always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
                used to determine a warranty return. Use the --smartCheck
                command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been
                tripped. Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART
                attributes.

        SAS Only:
        =========
        --sasPhy [identifier value]      (SAS Only)
                Use this option to specify a specific phy to use with another
                option that uses a phy identifier value. Some tool options will
                assume all SAS Phys when this option is not present. Others
                will produce an error when a specific phy is needed for an
                operation. Use the -i option to learn more about the supported
                phys.

        --readyLED [info | on | off | default] (SAS Only)
                Use this option to change the behavior of pin 11, the ready
                LED. See the SPL spec for full details on how this changes LED
                behavior.
                    info - gets the current state of the ready LED.
                    on - sets the ready LED to usually off unless
                         processing a command.
                    off - sets the ready LED to usually on unless
                          processing a command
                    default - sets the ready LED to the drive's default value

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --hideLBACounter
                Use this option to supress the output from options that show
                LBA counters without turning off all output to the screen.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --hours [hours]
                Use this option to specify a time in hours for a timed
                operation to run.

        --minutes [minutes]
                Use this option to specify a time in minutes for a timed
                operation to run.

        --seconds [seconds]
                Use this option to specify a time in seconds for a timed
                operation to run.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

       Windows only:
       --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Note: The time required to erase an entire drive may take several hours. The
erase time length is slightly longer than the time it takes to read the entire
drive. The SeaChest --deviceInfo command output has a line similar to this
example: 'Long Drive Self Test Time:  1 hour 38 minutes'. You can use the
reported time for your drive as being less than the time necessary to erase the
entire drive.

        --confirm I-understand-this-command-will-erase ... etc

        --overwrite [starting LBA | maxLBA]
                Use this option to start an overwrite erase at the specified
                starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to mean the beginning
                of the drive.  The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without
                quotes) may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive
                instead of the specific LBA number.  The overwrite data pattern
                will be all zeros (0000... etc) for the specified range.  You
                must combine this option with either the --overwriteRange to
                set the range count of the erasure, or the time settings
                (--minutes, etc. see above).

                Example: --overwrite 0 --overwriteRange 1000000
                         --overwrite 0 --hours 1 --minutes 30

                Important: If the end of the drive is reached before the time
                is up, the operation will continue at the beginning of the
                drive until the specified time is finished.  This means your
                starting LBA may not be the lowest LBA erased.  Use --overwrite
                and --overwriteRange together instead for more control of the
                starting and ending LBAs.  This test always issues write
                commands to the drive. No TRIM or UNMAP commands are used
                during this operation.

                Note: This erase may be used on HDD (hard disk drive) or SSD
                (solid state disk) devices, although not advised for SSD
                because it impacts endurance life due to abnormal write
                activity.

        --overwriteRange [LBA count]
                Use with the --overwrite option to specify a range of LBAs to
                erase on the selected drive.  If the starting LBA and the range
                count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of the drive)
                then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this command is
                omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the test will
                end at the MaxLBA.

        --trim [starting LBA | maxLBA]         (SATA and NVMe)
        --unmap [starting LBA | maxLBA]        (SAS only)
                Use this option to start a TRIM (SATA) or UNMAP (SAS) operation
                at the specified starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to
                mean the beginning of the drive.  The predefined text string
                "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to indicate the last
                sector on the drive instead of the specific LBA number.  These
                commands are common on SSD devices and less common on HDDs.
                You must combine this option with the corresponding --trimRange
                or --unmapRange to set the range of the operation.

        --trimRange [LBA count]         (SATA and NVMe)
        --unmapRange [LBA count]        (SAS only)
                Use one of these options to specify a range of LBAs to TRIM or
                UNMAP on a drive. A starting point must be specified with the
                corresponding --trim or --unmap option.  If the starting LBA
                and the range count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of
                the drive) then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this
                command is omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the
                test will end at the MaxLBA.

        --provision [newMaxLBA | maxLBA]        (Seagate Only)
                Provision your drive to a new max LBA to any value less than
                the device's current max LBA. The predefined text string
                "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to indicate the last
                sector on the drive instead of the specific LBA number.  A
                power cycle is required after this command before resetting the
                max LBA or changing the provisioning again. This command erases
                all data between the new maxLBA specified and the current
                maxLBA of the device. TRIM (SATA) or UNMAP (SAS) will be used
                when supported by the device, including SSDs.  For most HDDs
                this test will write 0's to the device and possibly take a very
                long time to complete.

 SeaChest_Configure Version: 1.17.0
 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Configure diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Configure is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
configure, change or set various properties on Seagate disk drives (this
includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie).  Some commands may cause existing
data on the drive to become inaccessible.  Some commands may affect the
performance of the drive.

NOTE: SeaChest_Configure may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Configure.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Be very careful using SeaChest_Configure. Power failure during a configuration
change may cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Usage - Linux
=============
        SeaChest_Configure [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_Configure --scan
        SeaChest_Configure -d /dev/sg2 --deviceInfo

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_Configure [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_Configure --scan
        SeaChest_Configure -d PD0 --deviceInfo

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --setMaxLBA [newMaxLBA | maxLBA]
                Set the max accessible address of your drive to any value less
                than the device's default native size. A power cycle is
                required after this command before resetting or setting a new
                max LBA. The final capacity will depend on the logical sector
                size.  If the Logical Block Address (LBA) is set to 1953125 and
                the sector size is 512, then the capacity is 1,000,000,000
                bytes. If the logical sector size is 4096, then the capacity is
                8,000,000,000 bytes.  If the logical sector size is 512 but the
                physical sector size is 4096 (called Advanced Format), then
                normal practice is to pick an LBA value which is divisible by
                8. Use the -i, --deviceInfo to show logical and physical sector
                sizes.  The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without quotes)
                may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive,
                otherwise see --restoreMaxLBA.

        --restoreMaxLBA
                Restore the max accessible address of your drive to its native
                size. A power cycle is required after this command before
                setting a new max LBA.

        --phySpeed [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5] (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to change the PHY speed to a new maximum value.
                This change persists over power cycles and resets. On SAS, this
                option will set all phys to the specified speed unless the
                --sasPhy option is given to select a specific phy.

                0 - allow full negotiation (default drive behavior)
                1 - allow negotiation up to 1.5Gb/s
                2 - allow negotiation up to 3.0Gb/s
                3 - allow negotiation up to 6.0Gb/s
                4 - allow negotiation up to 12.0Gb/s (SAS Only)
                5 - allow negotiation up to 22.5Gb/s (SAS Only)

        --readLookAhead [info | enable | disable]
                Use this option to enable or disable read look-ahead support on
                a drive.  Use the "info" argument to get the current status of
                the read look ahead feature.  This change is not preserved over
                power cycles.

        --writeCache [info | enable | disable]
                Use this option to enable or disable write cache support on a
                drive.  Use the "info" argument to get the current status of
                the write cache feature.  Changes may not be preserved over
                power cycles.

                Note: Windows, Device Manager, Disk drives, <your model>,
                Policies tab, Write-caching policy may override this
                --writeCache setting if the policy is enabled in Device
                Manager. You can change the Windows policy or you can try
                --sctWriteCache, if necessary, to control the cache regardless
                of the policy.

        SATA Only:
        ========
        --freeFall [info | enable | disable | sensitivity value]  (SATA only)
                Use this option to configure the Free Fall control feature
                found on some SATA drives. This feature allows the drive to
                take action if it detects it is in free fall to protect the
                data from harm due to a drop.

                info - use this to see the current sensitivity value
                enable - this option will set the sensitivity to the vendor's
                        recommended value.
                disable - this will disable the free fall control feature.
                sensitivity value - set a value between 1 and 255 to control
                        how sensitive the detection is. A value of zero will
                        set the vendor's recommended value.

        --lowCurrentSpinup [ enable | disable ]  (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the low current spinup
                feature on Seagate SATA drives. Note: This feature is not
                available on every drive.

        --puisFeature [enable | disable]  (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the Power Up In Standby
                (PUIS) feature on SATA drives.
                Note: If this is configured on the drive with a jumper, this
                      command will fail.
                Note2: Not all products support this feature.

        --sscFeature [info | default | enable | disable] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to change or view the SSC (Spread Spectrum
                Clocking) mode on a Seagate SATA drive. Only change this
                setting if you are experiencing compatibility problems with the
                drive in a system.

                info - show current SSC state
                default - set to drive default mode
                enable - enable SSC
                disable - disable SSC

        --sctReadTimer [info | value] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to set the SMART command transport read command
                timer value for synchronous commands and NCQ commands with
                in-order data delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at the
                time that the drive processes the command, not the time it is
                received. This timer value is volatile and is cleared at each
                power cycle. Use the "info" argument to get the current status
                of the read timer. A value of 0 means that all possible error
                recovery will be performed before returning status (i.e. the
                Read Command Timer is disabled). Other values should include a
                unit to know the time to use. If no unit is provided, it is
                assumed to be the value * 100 ms. The maximum time that can be
                specified is 1 hour, 49 minutes, 13 seconds. Note: On some SAT
                HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be determined due to
                HBA/bridge limitations.

                Ex1: --sctReadTimer 7s for a 7 second timer.
                Ex2: --sctReadTimer 7000ms for a 7 second timer expressed in
                     milliseconds
                Ex2: --sctReadTimer 70 for a 7 second timer with no units
                     specified

                Note: this command is part of SMART Command Transport Error
                Recovery Control (SCTERC). These commands may also be known as
                TLER or CCTL.  For additional information see
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_recovery_control .  Consult
                your RAID controller documentation to learn its timeout for
                determining drive failure and subsequent RAID rebuilding of a
                spare drive. These SCTERC commands, if supported by the drive
                firmware, allow setting a drive level timeout which is less
                than the RAID controller rebuild timeout.  For example, 7
                seconds on the drive and 8 seconds on the controller.  This
                time difference may allow the RAID to perform error recovery at
                the file level instead of replacing the device since the
                timeout may be caused by a sector that is just difficult to
                read, not an entire failure of the drive.

        --sctWriteCache [info | enable | disable | default]
                (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable write cache support on a
                drive using SMART command transport. When using this option,
                the setting is non-volatile. Use this with the --volatile flag
                to make the setting volatile. When using this option, the
                --writeCache will always return success, but no write cache
                changes will occur. This follows ATA spec. Using the "default"
                argument returns the drive to default settings and allowing the
                --writeCache option to work again. Use the "info" argument to
                get the current status of the write cache feature. Note: On
                some SAT HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be determined
                due to HBA/bridge limitations.

        --sctWriteCacheReordering [info | enable | disable | default]
                (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable write cache reordering
                support on a drive using SMART command transport. Write cache
                reordering allows the drive to reorder moving data out of cache
                to media for better performance on synchronous commands.
                Asynchronous commands are only affected when in-order data
                delivery is enabled. When using this option, the setting is
                non-volatile. Use this with the --volatile flag to make the
                setting volatile. Use the "info" argument to get the current
                status of the write cache reordering feature. Note: On some SAT
                HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be determined due to
                HBA/bridge limitations.

        --sctWriteTimer [info | value] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to set the SMART command transport write
                command timer value for synchronous commands and NCQ commands
                with in-order data delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at
                the time that the drive processes the command, not the time it
                is received. This timer value is volatile and is cleared at
                each power cycle. Use the "info" argument to get the current
                status of the write timer. A value of 0 means that all possible
                error recovery will be performed before returning status (i.e.
                the Write Command Timer is disabled). Other values should
                include a unit to know the time to use. If no unit is provided,
                it is assumed to be the value * 100 ms. The maximum time that
                can be specified is 1 hour, 49 minutes, 13 seconds. Note: On
                some SAT HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be determined
                due to HBA/bridge limitations.

                Ex1: --sctWriteTimer 7s for a 7 second timer.
                Ex2: --sctWriteTimer 7000ms for a 7 second timer expressed in
                     milliseconds
                Ex2: --sctWriteTimer 70 for a 7 second timer with no units
                     specified

                Note: see additional information above for --sctReadTimer.

        SAS Only:
        ========
        --readyLED [info | on | off | default] (SAS Only)
                Use this option to change the behavior of pin 11, the ready
                LED. See the SPL spec for full details on how this changes LED
                behavior.
                    info - gets the current state of the ready LED.
                    on - sets the ready LED to usually off unless
                         processing a command.
                    off - sets the ready LED to usually on unless
                          processing a command
                    default - sets the ready LED to the drive's default value

        --sasPhy [identifier value]
                Use this option to specify a specific phy to use with another
                option that uses a phy identifier value. Some tool options will
                assume all SAS Phys when this option is not present. Others
                will produce an error when a specific phy is needed for an
                operation. Use the -i option to learn more about the supported
                phys.

        --scsiLPReset [cumulative | threshold | defCumulative | defThreshold | all]   (SAS only)
                Use this option to reset all SCSI Log Pages. If the device is
                compliant with SPC4 or later, the --scsiLPResetPage option may
                be used to specify a specific page to reset. The --volatile
                option may also be passed to prevent saving changes.
                            cumulative - reset the cumulative values
                            threshold  - reset the threshold values
                            defCumulative - reset the cumulative values to
                               default without saving.
                            defThreshold  - reset the threshold values to
                               default without saving.
                            all - sends the log page reset command to all of
                               the above control values

        --scsiLPResetPage [page# | page-subpage#]               (SAS only)
                This option is used to specify a specific page, and/or subpage
                to be used with the --scsiLPReset option.
                NOTE: This option will only work on newer drives compliant with
                the SPC4 specification.

        --scsiMPReset [page# | page-subpage#]           (SAS only)
                This option will reset the specified mode page(s) to their
                default settings. Valid page numbers range from 0 to 3Fh. Valid
                subpage numbers range from 0 to FFh.

                (MP) Mode page 3Fh specifies all mode pages and can be used to
                reset all mode pages. (SP) Subpage FFh specifies all subpages
                of a given page and will reset all those subpages. Using both
                MP 3Fh and SP FFh will reset all pages and subpages on a device.

        --scsiMPRestore [page# | page-subpage#]         (SAS only)
                This option will restore the specified mode page(s) to their
                saved settings. Valid page numbers range from 0 to 3Fh. Valid
                subpage numbers range from 0 to FFh.

                (MP) Mode page 3Fh specifies all mode pages and can be used to
                restore all mode pages. (SP) Subpage FFh specifies all subpages
                of a given page and will restore all those subpages. Using both
                MP 3Fh and SP FFh will restore all pages and subpages on a
                device.

        --scsiMPSave [page# | page-subpage#]            (SAS only)
                This option will save the current specified mode page(s) to the
                saved settings. Valid page numbers range from 0 to 3Fh. Valid
                subpage numbers range from 0 to FFh.

                (MP) Mode page 3Fh specifies all mode pages and can be used to
                save all mode pages. (SP) Subpage FFh specifies all subpages of
                a given page and will save all those subpages. Using both MP
                3Fh and SP FFh will save all pages and subpages on a device.

         --setSCSIMP [ mp[-sp]:byte:highestBit:fieldWidthInBits=value | file=filename.txt ]  (SAS only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to set a specific field in a mode page to a
                value. There are two argument formats to this option:
                1. The first format expects a mode page (in hex), optionally a
                   subpage code (in hex), the byte offset that the field starts
                   at (in decimal), the highest bit the field starts at (0-7),
                   the width of the field in as a number of bits (decimal), and
                   the value to set (hex or decimal).  A maximum of 64bits can
                   be set at a time with this option.
                2. The second format is a text file that contains all bytes of
                   the mode page in hex. Each byte must be separated by a
                   space, new line, or underscore. It is recommended that this
                   file is created by copy-pasting the output of the
                   --showSCSIMP option's default classic view, then modifying
                   after that.

                Example use of the arguments:
                1. Setting WCE to zero on Caching MP 8 from command line:
                   command line: 08:2:2:1=0
                2. Setting DLC to one on Control Extension MP from command line:
                   command line: 0A-01:4:3:1=1
                3. Setting WCE to zero on Caching MP 8 from a text file:
                   command line: file=cachingModePage.txt
                   File contents: 88 12 10 00 FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF 90 20 00 00 00 00 00 00

        --showSCSIMP [page# | page-subpage#]            (SAS only)
                This option will display the specified mode page on the screen
                as raw hexadecimal data bytes. Use --showSCSIMPControl to
                control the output.  If --showSCSIMPControl is not provided,
                the current values will be shown.

                (MP) Mode page 3Fh specifies all mode pages and can be used to
                show all mode pages. (SP) Subpage FFh specifies all subpages of
                a given page and will show all those subpages. Using both MP
                3Fh and SP FFh will show all pages and subpages on a device.

                Note: page# is a decimal value unless it has the characters A
                through F, then it is hexadecimal. Page 18, for example,  would
                be 12h so be sure to say 18h if that is the page you want.

                Example: --showSCSIMP 3F-FF
                         --showSCSIMP 18h
                         --showSCSIMP 24    (shows page 18h)

        --showSCSIMPControl [current | default | saved | changeable | all]  (SAS only)
                Use this option to control the output of the --showSCSIMP
                option.
                        current - show the current values of the mode page.
                        default - show the default values of the mode page.
                        saved   - show the saved values of the mode page.
                        changeable - show the changeable fields in a mode page.
                        all - show all of the above formats for a given mode
                              page.
                Example: --showSCSIMP 8 --showSCSIMPControl all

        --showMPOutputMode [classic | buffer]   (SAS Only)
                Use this option to control the format of the output when
                displaying a SCSI mode page. Modes:
                   classic - This output is a classic output from old SCSI
                      manuals where the bytes of the page are output in a
                      series of rows across the screen in hexadecimal format.
                   buffer  - This output is a formatted buffer showing offsets
                      on the top and side in hex. This will output each row
                      with up to 16 bytes of data before moving to the next row.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        --confirm I-understand-this-command-will-erase ... etc

        --provision [newMaxLBA | maxLBA]        (Seagate Only)
                Provision your drive to a new max LBA to any value less than
                the device's current max LBA. The predefined text string
                "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to indicate the last
                sector on the drive instead of the specific LBA number.  A
                power cycle is required after this command before resetting the
                max LBA or changing the provisioning again. This command erases
                all data between the new maxLBA specified and the current
                maxLBA of the device. TRIM (SATA) or UNMAP (SAS) will be used
                when supported by the device, including SSDs.  For most HDDs
                this test will write 0's to the device and possibly take a very
                long time to complete.

SeaChest_Erase - Seagate drive utilities
 Copyright (c) 2014-2019 Seagate Technology LLC and/or its Affiliates, All Rights Reserved
 SeaChest_Erase Version: 2.0.1
 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Erase diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Erase is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
efficiently erase data on Seagate disk drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor,
Samsung and LaCie).

NOTE: SeaChest_Erase may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

NOTE: Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 and newer do not support the Sanitize
command set.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Erase.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

Some of the erase options will require you to enable ATA Trusted Trusted
Computing Group (TCG) commands support for your Linux operating system. Please
see the section below "Enabling TCG Commands In Linux" for information about
this requirement.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

If this is not your drive and the original owner has no claim of ownership to
it or the data stored on it, then you may still be responsible for the data in
your possession.   To protect yourself from potential liability and to protect
the previous owner's privacy, you should remove all data by performing a data
erasure on this drive.

Be very careful because using SeaChest_Erase will cause data loss. Seagate is
not responsible for lost user data.

Usage - Linux
=============
        SeaChest_Erase [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_Erase --scan
        SeaChest_Erase -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_Erase --device /dev/sg1 --sanitize info

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_Erase [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_Erase --scan
        SeaChest_Erase -d PD2 -i
        SeaChest_Erase --device PD1 --sanitize info

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add--usbChildInfo to
                display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --displayLBA [LBA | maxLBA]
                This option will read and display the contents of the specified
                LBA to the screen. The display format is hexadecimal with an
                ASCII translation on the side (when available).  The predefined
                text string "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to
                indicate the last sector on the drive instead of the specific
                LBA number.

        --showEraseSupport
                This option checks the drive to determine which methods of data
                erasure are supported and lists them, from fastest to slowest.
                Gives overwrite erase time estimate.

        --poll
                Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
                until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
                command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
                and the final test result.  Full drive procedures will take a
                very long time.  Used with --sanitize, --secureErase (SATA),
                --writeSame (SATA), or --formatUnit (SAS).

        --progress [sanitize, format]
                Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default)
                specify a test to check progress. The progress counts up from
                0% to 100%.

        --showPhysicalElementStatus
                Use this option to see the status/health of the storage
                elements inside a drive. Use the element # shown with the
                --removePhysicalElement option to remove that storage element
                from use. This option can also be used to see if a depopulation
                is still in progress or if it has completed.  See the section
                below 'Interpreting Head Health and Status' for more
                information.

        --psid [32-digit alpha numeric code from drive label]
                This option can be used to specify the value of the PSID.
                This may be required in order to perform certain TCG
                operations.

                The PSID (Physical Security IDentification number) is a
                32-digit number & capital letter sequence printed on the label.
                There is no electronic query for this number, therefore the
                drive must be removed in order to read the PSID number.  Many
                drives have a PSID code on the label but are NOT marked as
                "Seagate Secure"; these drives do not support revertSP
                cryptographic erase.

                Enter the PSID without spaces. FIVE attempts are allowed before
                a power cycle is required. It can also be read by 2D barcode
                reader. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults.

                Example: --revertSP --psid 123ALL32DIGITS123ALL32DIGITS123A

        --sid [yourTCGpassword]
                This option can be used to specify the value of SID. This may
                be required in order to perform certain TCG operations. If this
                is not provided, MSID will be used.  As a practical matter, if
                you have implemented TCG boot authentication software tools,
                then the actual password may be completely different from the
                drive's point of view.  In other words, software and BIOS tools
                commonly run hash algorithms or use keyboard scan codes as
                added security instead of plain ASCII characters when saving
                drive passwords.

                You may need to cryptographically erase all data on the drive
                with --revertSP to clear the existing SID before the
                lock|unlock options can be set before installing the operating
                system and user data.  You should consult you TCG software
                vendor for instruction and advice about disabling or removing
                the SID before erasing your data.

                If the SID or MSID are not set (such as a new drive) then the
                various lock|unlock commands won't need the --sid option.

                Example: --revert --sid yourTCGpassword

SATA Only
---------
        --ataSATsecurityProtocol [enable | disable]         (SATA only)
                This option can be used to force enable or disable using the
                ATA security protocol as specified in the SAT specification. By
                default, the tool will use this method when it is supported to
                allow the SATL to understand and manage the security commands
                being performed and prevent other issues.

                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If a drive
                lost power during an ATA Security Erase in SeaChest, then using
                the password SeaChest with type 'user' will remove the temporary
                password set by the utility.

                Example:
                --ataSATsecurityProtocol disable --ataSecPassword SeaChest --ataSecPassType user

                Some commands like --scan and --deviceInfo will still run on a
                locked drive. To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS
                must have set the password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash
                the password typed in the configuration however it chooses and
                this utility has no idea how to match what the BIOS has done so
                it may not always work to remove a password set by something
                other than this utility. See the --ataSecPWMod command below
                for additional alternatives.

        --ataSecPassword ["ASCII password" | SeaChest | empty]      (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify a password to use with an ATA
                security operation. If specifying a password with spaces,
                quotes must be used. If SeaChest is given, the default SeaChest
                password will be used. If empty is given, an empty password
                will be used.

                Examples:
                  "This is a valid password"
                  ThisIsAlsoValid
                  "This password uses \"quotes\"
                  "This password is \/\/eird"

                Note: Windows PE offers an ATA Security Erase feature. If the
                erase is interrupted then a temporary password
                AutoATAWindowsString12345678901 is still set.

                Note: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        --ataSecPassType [user | master]                (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify if the password being given with the
                --ataSecPassword option is a user or a master password. If this
                option is not provided, user is assumed.

        --ataSecPWMod [byteswapped | zeropad | spacepad | fpad | leftAlign |
          rightAlign | uppercase | lowercase | invertcase] (SATA Only)
                Use this option to have the utility make modifications to the
                ATA security password to attempt other various ways it may be
                sent by a system bios. These are not guaranteed to work, but
                may help unlock a drive that was locked by a BIOS that encoded
                the password in a unique way. This option can be presented
                multiple times to select multiple modifications.

                EX: --ataSecPWMod byteswapped --ataSecPWMod invertcase
                  byteswapped - byteswaps the password. EX: blah -> lbha
                  zeropad - zero pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  spacepad - space pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  fpad - pads the passwords with Fh (all 1's) if less than
                     32characters
                  leftAlign - left aligns the password in the buffer
                  rightAlign - right aligns the password in the buffer
                  uppercase - sends the password as all uppercase
                  lowercase - sends the password as all lowercase
                  invertcase - switches uppercase for lower, and lowercase for
                  upper

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest_Erase version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --hideLBACounter
                Use this option to supress the output from options that show
                LBA counters without turning off all output to the screen.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --hours [hours]
                Use this option to specify a time in hours for a timed
                operation to run.

        --minutes [minutes]
                Use this option to specify a time in minutes for a timed
                operation to run.

        --seconds [seconds]
                Use this option to specify a time in seconds for a timed
                operation to run.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Note: The time required to erase an entire drive may take several hours. The
erase time length is slightly longer than the time it takes to read the entire
drive. The SeaChest --deviceInfo command output has a line similar to this
example: 'Long Drive Self Test Time:  1 hour 38 minutes'. You can use the
reported time for your drive as being less than the time necessary to erase the
entire drive.

        --confirm this-command-will-erase-data ... etc

        --performQuickestErase (Seagate Only)
                This option checks the drive to determine which methods of data
                erasure are supported and determines which is the quickest to
                erase ALL data on the drive. It then starts the quickest erase.
                Combine this option with the --poll option to enable polling
                for progress on the fastest erase.  See also --showEraseSupport.

                Note 1: Some erase methods require polling and will have polling
                enabled by default.

                Note 2: If revertSP is the fastest, it will not be started
                since the drive PSID must be passed in on the command line.

                Note 3: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

Note: Windows 8 (and newer) native drivers block Sanitize commands.

        --sanitize [info | blockerase | cryptoerase | overwrite | freezelock |
                    antifreezelock]
                Use the info argument to show supported sanitize operations.
                Optionally, use blockerase, cryptoerase, or overwrite to start
                a sanitize operation.

                Example:--sanitize info
                Example:--sanitize blockerase

                * blockerase on some solid state drives (SSD) is very fast at
                less than one (1) second, while on other SSDs it can take
                longer than 30 seconds. It performs a physical low level block
                erase operation on all current, past and potential user data
                making previous data irretrievable. Consider using the --poll
                option to monitor % completion.

                * cryptoerase is usually very fast at less than one (1) second.
                It changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. Some products may
                take a few minutes to fully finish this command option.

                * overwrite physically overwrites all current, past and
                potential user data. The ATA specification gives overwrite the
                option to set a user defined pattern and multiple passes.
                SeaChest_Erase will use zeros (0) and one pass.

                Overwrite on hard disk drives (HDD) takes a very long time to
                complete at approximately three (3) hours per terabyte. Once
                this command starts it must finish the overwrite erase before
                normal use of the drive is returned. Even if a power reset is
                performed during overwrite erase the drive will continue from
                where it was stopped until it reaches the end of the of
                erasure. Automatic sector reallocation (repair) is permitted
                during the operation of this function.

                The optional --poll argument does not return to the command
                prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%) and the
                final test result. Otherwise, the Sanitize command begins and
                immediately returns to the command prompt.  Use the --progress
                sanitize command to check on the completion percentage (%) and
                test result.

                * freezelock is a command to block processing of sanitize
                operations until a power cycle is performed on a device. It is
                only available on ATA drives. Once this command has been sent,
                the freezelock status becomes immediate and cannot be cleared
                until the drive has been powered off. All sanitize commands,
                except a sanitize status will be aborted.

                * antifreezelock is a command which is designed to block a
                freezelock command from locking out the sanitize feature set.
                It is only available on ATA drives that support the ACS3, or
                higher specification.

        --overwrite [starting LBA | maxLBA]
                Use this option to start an overwrite erase at the specified
                starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to mean the beginning
                of the drive.  The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without
                quotes) may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive
                instead of the specific LBA number.  The overwrite data pattern
                will be all zeros (0000... etc) for the specified range.  You
                must combine this option with either the --overwriteRange to
                set the range count of the erasure, or the time settings
                (--minutes, etc. see above).

                Example: --overwrite 0 --overwriteRange 1000000
                         --overwrite 0 --hours 1 --minutes 30

                Important: If the end of the drive is reached before the time
                is up, the operation will continue at the beginning of the
                drive until the specified time is finished.  This means your
                starting LBA may not be the lowest LBA erased.  Use --overwrite
                and --overwriteRange together instead for more control of the
                starting and ending LBAs.  This test always issues write
                commands to the drive. No TRIM or UNMAP commands are used
                during this operation.

                Note: This erase may be used on HDD (hard disk drive) or SSD
                (solid state disk) devices, although not advised for SSD
                because it impacts endurance life due to abnormal write
                activity.

        --overwriteRange [LBA count]
                Use with the --overwrite option to specify a range of LBAs to
                erase on the selected drive.  If the starting LBA and the range
                count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of the drive)
                then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this command is
                omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the test will
                end at the MaxLBA.

        --trim [starting LBA | maxLBA]         (SATA and NVMe)
        --unmap [starting LBA | maxLBA]        (SAS only)
                Use this option to start a TRIM (SATA) or UNMAP (SAS) operation
                at the specified starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to
                mean the beginning of the drive.  The predefined text string
                "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to indicate the last
                sector on the drive instead of the specific LBA number.  These
                commands are common on SSD devices and less common on HDDs.
                You must combine this option with the corresponding --trimRange
                or --unmapRange to set the range of the operation.

        --trimRange [LBA count]         (SATA and NVMe)
        --unmapRange [LBA count]        (SAS only)
                Use one of these options to specify a range of LBAs to TRIM or
                UNMAP on a drive. A starting point must be specified with the
                corresponding --trim or --unmap option.  If the starting LBA
                and the range count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of
                the drive) then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this
                command is omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the
                test will end at the MaxLBA.

        --writeSame [starting LBA | maxLBA]
                Use this option to start a WRITE SAME erase at the specified
                starting LBA.  Use 0 for the starting LBA to mean the beginning
                of the drive.  The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without
                quotes) may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive
                instead of the specific LBA number.  The Write Same data
                pattern will be all zeros (0000... etc) for the specified
                range.  You must combine this option with the --writeSameRange
                to set the range of the erasure.

                On SCSI devices, this uses the writesame16 command. On ATA
                devices, this uses the SCT writesame feature.

                Note: For SATA drives, adding the --poll option will cause this
                operation to poll for progress until complete. This is not
                available on SAS and SCSI drives because SCSI drives do not
                report the progress on a Write Same operation.

        --writeSameRange [LBA count]
                Use with the --writeSame option to specify a range of LBAs to
                erase on the selected drive.  If the starting LBA and the range
                count together exceed the MaxLBA (last sector of the drive)
                then the test will end at the MaxLBA.  Also, if this command is
                omitted then the end of the drive is assumed and the test will
                end at the MaxLBA.

        --revert
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification Revert on a Self Encrypting
                Drive (SED). This operation is only available on Seagate TCG
                Opal drives. Seagate SED drives are marked on the label with
                the words "Seagate Secure".  No all Seagate SED drives are TCG
                Opal compliant.

                In order to complete this operation, the lockingSP must not be
                activated, as this option will activate it in order to perform
                the revert. The value of SID, must also be the value of MSID as
                this operation must authenticate as SID using the value of
                MSID. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults. If this operation fails, use
                --revertSP instead.

                Example: --revert --sid yourTCGpassword

        --revertSP
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification revertSP on a Self
                Encrypting Drive (SED). This operation is available on all
                Seagate SED drives which may be marked on the label with the
                word "SED". Requires the --psid code from the label.

                Note: To determine if your drive supports cryptographic erase
                you can run --showEraseSupport --deviceInfo (look for
                'Encryption Support: Self Encrypting' and 'TCG'.

                Example: --revertSP --psid 123ALL32DIGITS123ALL32DIGITS123A
                Note: If a Secure product does not recognize the --revertSP
                --psid combination, try --revert --psid as the two commands are
                closely related.

        --pattern [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue |
             file:filename]
                Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
                operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs or
                the whole drive.

                * repeat - without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
                hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This pattern
                will be repeated until it fills the logical size of the LBA.
                i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
                Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
                      unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be
                      given for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or
                      0000FFFFh

                * random - the entire logical sector size will be filled with
                random bytes. This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
                desired range.

                * increment - enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
                this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.

                * file - user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
                will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector
                size.
                Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
                Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
                        local directory.
                Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit
                        pattern. The file option will get truncated to a 32bit
                        pattern for SATA products.

        --removePhysicalElement [element #] (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to remove a storage element from use on a
                drive. When this is done, the drive will erase all user data
                and lower the capacity to a new point where the drive is still
                usable without the provided element #. Use the
                --showPhysicalElementStatus option to see the status of the
                depopulation operation.

        SATA Only
        =========
        --ataSecureErase [normal | enhanced]          (SATA only)
                Use the normal or enhanced argument to start an ATA security
                erase on a device.

                * normal writes binary zeros (0) to all user data areas.

                * enhanced writes binary zeros (0) to all user data areas,
                including sectors that are no longer in use due to
                reallocation. Not all drives support the enhanced mode. For
                some models (ISE enabled), enhanced mode erase can take seconds
                because it uses crypto erase internally.

                ATA Security Erase on standard drives (non-SED) takes a very
                long time to complete at approximately three (3) hours per
                terabyte. Self Encrypting Drives (SED) may run an quick
                cryptographic erase by changing the drive's encryption keys.
                The industry standard command ATA Security Erase begins by
                locking the drive with a temporary password which is cleared at
                the end of the erasure. Do not run this command unless you have
                ample time to allow it to run through to the end. If the
                procedure is interrupted prior to completion, then the drive
                will remain in a locked state and you must manually restart it
                from the beginning. The temporary password to unlock the drive
                is "SeaChest", plain ASCII letters without the quotes.  See the
                various ATA password options in the Utility Arguments section
                above.

                If the drive reports that it is freezelocked, then this is
                usually put on by a BIOS command at startup.  After the
                operating system is finished booting you can try removing the
                power to just the hard drive.  This should allow it to restart
                without the freezelock command.

                Note: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        SAS Only
        ========
        --formatUnit [current | new sector size]    (SAS Only) (Seagate Only)
                This option will start a format unit operation on a SAS drive
                Use "current" to perform a format unit operation with the
                Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector
                size to use upon format completion.

                Valid sector sizes are given by the --showSupportedSectorSizes
                command (see above) or  listed in the device Product Manual.
                This command will erase all data on the drive. The security
                initialize feature is not used and protection information will
                not be set. Combine this option with --poll or --progress to
                check for completion status until the format is complete.

                Warning: Once a Format Unit command is started it must be
                allowed to finish in order to calculate the total number of
                logical blocks (LBAs) at the finish.  If the sector size has
                changed then there will be a corresponding change to the total
                number of LBAs. If a device stops a Format Unit before it
                completes then the device will report a "Corrupted Format"
                sense code, "03-31".  Restart the format and allow it to finish
                to correct this error.

        --fastFormat [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)
                You must use this option with the --formatUnit option to run a
                fast format. Available fast format modes:
                    0 - This is a standard format unit command. All logical
                        blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a
                        very long time.
                    1 - This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
                        data in the physical sector. This option can be used to
                        quickly change the the logical sector size between 5xx
                        emulation and 4xxx native logical block sizes.
                        Resulting LBA (sector) count is either /8 or *8 the
                        current Read Capacity, depending on the direction of
                        the conversion.  The media may be readable, but data
                        may be unspecified or may return errors on read access
                        according to it's error processing algorithms.
                    2 - This is a fast format unit command that can change the
                        logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be
                        read accessible until a write has been performed to
                        the media.

                Example: --formatUnit 512 --fastFormat 1 --confirm I-... etc
                Example: --formatUnit 4096 --fastFormat 1 --confirm I-... etc

                Note: See the help topic below: About FastFormat)

Interpreting Head Health and Status
-----------------------------------
Beginning in 2016, some Seagate nearline drives started to support the
Remanufacture command set which allows a disk drive with a manageable
read/write head problem to remain in service at a reduced capacity by
"depopulating" the head element.  You can check if a drive supports the
Remanufacture command set by running --deviceInfo and looking for 'Storage
Element Depopulation' in the list of supported features.  (Not to be confused
with 'SATA Rebuild Assist' which is a feature used to rebuild RAID systems.)

A drive failure (due to a head problem) that is easily removed from the system
is replaced with a spare drive.  A drive that is nearly inaccessible may make
sense to remain in the system at a reliable lesser capacity by depopulating the
problem head.

If supported by the drive, the --showPhysicalElementStatus command will display
a simple table showing head number, type, health, and status.

The Health level is represented like a percentage, 0-100.  0 is perfectly
healthy, 100 = at manufacturer's limit, above this to 207 is above the
manufacturer's limit. A report of 254 means a depopulate is in progress.

The Status levels are active, in limit, degraded, truncated, truncate failed.

If a drive head has developed isolated, degraded performance, and does not
affect any other reliability in the system, then the head can be removed from
service. A drive with seven platters and fourteen heads would lose 1/14th of
its storage capacity, or ~7%.  Likewise, a four head drive would lose 25%.

If a drive is reported as "degraded" by --showPhysicalElementStatus then it can
be depopulated using the --removePhysicalElement command.  When a head is
depopulated the drive must perform a complete full pack write; this is
obviously data destructive and takes a very long time to complete.

When disk drives are built the post assembly factory process includes media
scanning, any defects mapping, defining sector sizes, and establishing system,
cache and data zones.  This activity is generically known as a low-level
format.  During head depopulation (i.e. removing a physical element) the drive
performs a kind of 'mid-level format' using Sanitize Overwrite which has the
unique behavior that once started it must finish.  If power is interrupted
during a Sanitize Overwrite it will pick up again where it left off when power
returns.

==============================
Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
==============================
Abstract
--------
The SeaChest_Erase --revert and --revertSP commands require specific support be
enabled in the Linux kernel.  This document describes the process to enable
support for sending ATA Trusted Trusted Computing Group (TCG) commands in
Linux. The focus is on how to do this through Ubuntu Linux 14.04LTS, however,
the process should apply to other Linuxs as well although others may vary
slightly.

Modifying The GRUB Configuration File (Ubuntu example used)
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to make the change to allow TCG commands persist across reboots, you
must modify the kernel boot parameters. In Ubuntu, this is accomplished by
modifying the GRUB 2 configuration file. This section references the Grub2
configuration documentation from the Ubuntu Community:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup#Configuring_GRUB_2

Follow these steps to perform this modification in Ubuntu (other Linuxs may be
similar).

1. You must modify the file /etc/default/grub. You can do this by running "sudo
gedit /etc/default/grub"

2. Once this file is open in the editor of your choice, add
"libata.allow_tpm=1" to the line  that begins with "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT"
(or which ever line in grub is the one you use to boot your kernel, but this is
the default).

3. Close your editor

4. Run the command "sudo update-grub" to apply your changes to the grub boot
configuration (the file modified in these steps is a config file for the config
file).

5. Restart your computer to make this active

Temporarily Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
------------------------------------------
You can temporarily enable TCG commands without modifying the kernel boot
parameters. This can be accomplished by modifying the libata parameters file.
Below is a sample script that can be run to do this.

Sample Script:

cd /sys/module/libata/parameters
sudo chmod 644 allow_tpm
echo 1 | sudo dd of=./allow_tpm
sudo chmod 444 allow_tpm

Tiny Core - Enabling TCG Commands
------------------------------------------
Follow these steps to enable TCG commands on a Tiny Core bootable USB flash
drive.

1. Leave the USB flash drive in after you run the Windows-based USB boot maker
tool.

2. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/boot/syslinux.cfg and in there, add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the append line with the other kernel boot parameters.

3. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/EFI/boot/refind.conf and add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the options line with the other kernel boot parameters

Alternate method:
If Linux is already booted and you only want to temporarily enable TCG
commands, you can change the contents of
/sys/module/libata/parameters/allow_tpm from "0" to a "1".

 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Firmware diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Firmware is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
update firmware, also known as microcode, on Seagate disk drives (this includes
Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie).

Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest firmware can improve
performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate recommends applying
new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability of your drive.  Like
any software, firmware is improved over time and problems are also fixed.
Every drive family has a couple of firmware releases during the life of the
product. Please check in regularly to determine if new firmware is available
for your drive.

SeaChest_Firmware allows for both single drive and sequential batch mode
firmware download.

NOTE: SeaChest_Firmware may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

NOTE: Windows severely restricts downloading firmware to SATA drives.  Please
see the section below "Windows Restrictions Over SATA Firmware Downloads".
SeaChest_Firmware may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Firmware.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Be very careful using SeaChest_Firmware. Power failure during a firmware
download will cause data loss. Never apply firmware to a drive unless you are
certain that the firmware data file is specifically prepared for your drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

=============
        SeaChest_Firmware [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_Firmware --scan
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 --fwdlInfo
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 --downloadFW fwfilename
        SeaChest_Firmware -d /dev/sg2 --fwdlConfig configfile.cfs

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_Firmware [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_Firmware --scan
        SeaChest_Firmware -d PD2 -i
        SeaChest_Firmware -d PD2 --fwdlInfo
        SeaChest_Firmware -d PD2 --fwdlConfig configfile.cfs

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --fwdlInfo
                Use this option to show the firmware download support
                information for a drive.

        --downloadFW [firmware filename]    (Seagate Only)
                Download firmware to a Seagate storage product. Use only
                Seagate authorized firmware data files which are designated for
                the specific model drive. Improper use of this option may harm
                a device and or its data. You may specify the path (without
                spaces) if the firmware data file is in a different location.
                This option will use segmented download by default. Use the
                --downloadMode option to specify a different download mode.

                Please see the section below "Windows Restrictions Over SATA
                Firmware Downloads".

        --downloadMode [full | segmented | deferred]    (Seagate Only)
                Use this command along with the --downloadFW option to set the
                firmware download mode.

                Supported Modes:
                     full      - Performs a download in one large transfer to
                                 the device.
                     segmented - Downloads the firmware in multiple segments to
                                 the device. (Most compatible)
                     deferred  - Performs a segmented download to the device,
                                 but does not activate the new firmware until a
                                 power cycle or activate command is sent. Drives
                                 with this feature are not common. See
                                 --activateFW.

                Note: See the --modelMatch and --onlyFW utility options which
                may assist in creating commands to update multiple similar
                drives.

        --activateFW     (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to issue the command to activate code that was
                sent to the drive using a deferred download command. This will
                immediately activate the new code on the drive. You can use
                this along with a --downloadFW and --downloadMode deferred to
                automatically issue the activate command after the deferred
                download has completed.

        --fwdlConfig [config file]      (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to specify a configuration file to perform an
                update based on a firmware match on multiple drives or a single
                drive in the system.  You may specify the path if the file is
                in a different location. Configuration files consist of model
                numbers, previous compatible firmware and the appropriate
                matching new firmware.  Configuration files may be written to
                support multiple models at a time.  See the section below
                "Firmware Configuration Files" for more information on this
                subject.

        --fwdlDryRun
                Use this option to compare a given config file to the drives in
                a system without performing a firmware update. This can be used
                to check if any drives in the system require an update.

        --fwdlSegSize [segment size in 512B blocks]     (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to specify a segment size in 512B blocks to use
                for a segmented or deferred download. This option will not
                affect an immediate download (full buffer at once). The default
                segment size used is 64. Larger segment sizes may be faster,
                however they may also be incompatible with controllers or
                drivers in the system. Smaller values are more likely to be
                compatible, but also slower. Use this option if the default
                used by the tool is not working correctly for firmware updates.

        --firmwareSlot/--fwBufferID slot#               (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to specify a firmware slot (NVMe) or a buffer
                ID (SCSI) along with the --downloadMode (SCSI) or --activateFW
                (NVMe & SCSI) options.  If this option is not used, a value of
                zero will be used instead, which means the drive will
                automatically select the slot number.

        --calculateFileHash [file]
                Use this option to calculate the hash of a file. The following
                hashes are computed and shown on the screen:
                    MD5
                    SHA1
                    SHA2_224
                    SHA2_256
                    SHA2_384
                    SHA2_512

        --allowFlexibleFWDLAPIUse
                This option is used to control when to use the Windows 10+
                Firmware Download API calls. Default behavior is to only use
                this call when the interface and drive and command all match.
                The default behavior means that only ATA drives on an ATA
                interface with a ATA download command will use this call. SCSI
                SAS drives with a supported write buffer command will also use
                this call. Using this option allows a detected ATA drive on any
                interface to use this call if the OS/driver supports it
                regardless of the command being sent by the opensea-transport
                library.

        --forceFWDLPassthrough
                This option is used to control when to use the Windows 10+
                Firmware Download API calls. This option will force using ATA
                or SCSI passthrough to issue the FWDL commands instead of
                automatically selecting passthrough or the Win10 API. It is
                strongly recommended that this option only be used when
                troubleshooting problems when updating firmware. The Win10 API
                allows for tracking device firmware version changes in real
                time. This is not possible with passthrough commands which may
                require a system restart for Windows to detect the new version
                of firmware.

        NVMe Only
        =========
        --switchFW      (NVMe Only)     (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to switch to a different firmware slot on an
                NVMe drive. You must specify a slot with the --firmwareSlot
                option or this will fail. The specified slot must already have
                a valid firmware image in it as well.

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --newFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to skip drives matching the provided firmware
                revision. This option will only do an exact match. This option
                should be used to skip performing an update if a drive already
                has this firmware revision loaded. The option --childNewFW may
                be used to match drives in USB enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

============================
Firmware Configuration Files
============================
There are two types of SeaChest_Firmware configuration (config) files:
encrypted CFS and plain text CFG.

Seagate-prepared configuration files are encrypted and carry the file extension
CFS.  Seagate does not decrypt or disclose the contents of its CFS files.

Alternatively, you may prepare your own plain text configuration files which
must use the file extension CFG.  SeaChest_Firmware configuration files are
simple text with multiple lines. Each line defines a model and previous
firmware match up to a new firmware data file.  The structure of each line is
this:

  fullModelNumber;$FWREV$oldFwVersion;fwDataFile;(optional)$FWREV$newFwVersion

No spaces, the first $FWREV$ and all three semi-colons (;) are mandatory.

Note: The full model number is the ELECTRONIC version.  The label shows a
shorter version which may not include all of the necessary digits.  When you
run SeaChest -s or --scan the output will display the full electronic model
number.  For example the label may show ST4000DX001 but the full model is
actually ST4000DX001-1CE168.  You must use the full model numbers as given by
the --scan command.

The --scan commmand also shows the current firmware, such as CC46 or SN03 or
0002 or 0001SDM7.  There are several possible variations.  This corresponds to
the old firmware version.  You must precede the old firmware version with these
exact characters $FWREV$, like $FWREV$0001SDM7.

Seagate is the only authorized source for a firmware data file. The file name
and or other documentation should provide the new firmware version for the file.

The last section of the data line is optional, the new firmware version.  If
you include this information correctly, then SeaChest_Firmware may give a
message stating that the drive already has the new firmware.  If you omit the
new firmware details then you must still end the text string with a semi-colon
(;).

For example, this is a four-line configuration file for three different models
and three different firmware data files (not all model numbers have the longer
electronic version):

ST4000DX001-1CE168;$FWREV$CC42;BarracudaXT-CC44.LOD;$FWREV$CC44
ST4000DX001-1CE168;$FWREV$CC43;BarracudaXT-CC44.LOD;$FWREV$CC44
ST120FP0021;$FWREV$B770;SSD-B775.BIN;
ST4000NM0043;$FWREV$0004;Constellation3TB-0005.lod;$FWREV$0005

Remember, no spaces, the first $FWREV$ and all three semi-colons (;) are
mandatory.

Caution:  Firmware download configuration files assume you have knowledge about
which models are compatible with the associated firmware files.  If you are
unsure about the compatibility then you should NOT attempt to download the
firmware to the drive.  Never apply firmware to a drive unless you are certain
that the firmware data file is specifically prepared for your drive. Be very
careful using SeaChest_Firmware. Power failure during a firmware download will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Finally, you may optionally add a hash check calculation on the firmware data
file to the SeaChest_Firmware configuration file.  Simply, run the
--calculateFileHash option on the firmware data file.  For example, run a MD5
calculation on the file and then add "@MD5=61b33014f2d2a4f9553f6ef64fb82e31"
(substituting your calculation) immediately following the file name, before the
semi-colon (;).  For example:

ST4000DX001-1CE168;$FWREV$CC43;BarracudaXT-CC44.LOD@MD5=61b33014f2d2a4f9553f6ef64fb82e31;$FWREV$CC44

SeaChest_Firmware will compare its own MD5 calculation to the value in the
configuration file and if they do not match then the procedure will abort.  Six
types of hash calculations are supported up to SHA2_512.

 SeaChest_Format Version: 1.4.0
 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Format diagnostic software.

Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces are
able to perform a full low-level media format in the field.  These three
storage interfaces use, in generic terms, the SCSI command set.  Unlike SATA,
which is low-level formatted only at the factory, SCSI command devices are able
to rescan the surface of the media while managing defective sectors (if any)
and even change the drive sector size.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers
many specialty options to accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune
the procedure.

Some RAID adapters, for example, use 520 byte sectors rather than the common
512 size.  Because of this ability to change to a new sector size (also called
block size), the resulting number of total sectors (Logical Block Addresses or
LBAs) on a drive can vary and the actual final count is determined at the end
of the format.  In simple terms, if the new sector size is twice a large as the
previous format then the new count of sectors is half of what it was.

The SCSI Format Unit command is a drive background command which means that
once the command is accepted by the drive it then goes offline to manage the
task with no overhead impact to the host system.  The drive will report
formatting progress in 1% increments.

Important note: Once a Format Unit command has begun on a device then it must
be allowed to complete to be usable again.  If the format is interrupted then
it will subsequently report a  corrupted format with Sense Key "03-31".  The
only way to clear a corrupted format error is to start again and allow it to
finish.

        03h - Medium error. The command was terminated with a non-recoverable
        error condition, probably caused by a flaw in the media or an error in
        the recorded data.
        31h - The media format is corrupted.

Please see the section below "About the SCSI Format Unit Command" for
additional information.

NOTE: SeaChest_Format may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

If this is not your drive and the original owner has no claim of ownership to
it or the data stored on it, then you may still be responsible for the data in
your possession.   To protect yourself from potential liability and to protect
the previous owner's privacy, you should remove all data by performing a data
erasure on this drive.

Be very careful because using SeaChest_Format will cause data loss. Seagate

Usage - Linux
=============
        SeaChest_Format [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_Format --scan
        SeaChest_Format -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_Format --device /dev/sg1 --showSupportedSectorSizes

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_Format [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_Format --scan
        SeaChest_Format -d PD2 -i
        SeaChest_Format --device PD1 --showSupportedSectorSizes

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add--usbChildInfo to
                display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --displayLBA [LBA | maxLBA]
                This option will read and display the contents of the specified
                LBA to the screen. The display format is hexadecimal with an
                ASCII translation on the side (when available).  The predefined
                text string "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to
                indicate the last sector on the drive instead of the specific
                LBA number.

        --poll
                Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
                until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
                command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
                and the final test result.  Full drive procedures will take a
                very long time.  Used with --sanitize, --secureErase (SATA),
                --writeSame (SATA), or --Format (SAS).

        --progress [format]
                Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default)
                specify a test to check progress. The progress counts up from
                0% to 100%.

        --showSupportedFormats
                This option will show the supported formats of a device. These
                can be used to change the sector size or used with a format
                operation. On SAS, this is the supported block lengths and
                protection types VPD page (SBC4 and later). On SATA, this is
                the sector configuration log (ACS4 and later). If the device
                does not report supported sector sizes, please consult your
                product manual.

        SAS Only:
        ========
        --showFormatStatusLog (SAS Only)
                Use this option to view the SCSI format status log. Note: This
                log is only valid after a successful format unit operation.

        --showSupportedProtectionTypes (SAS Only)
                Use this option to view the supported protection types for a
                device. Run -i or --deviceInfo to see current protection type,
                if any.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest_Format in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest_Format version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Note: The time required to erase an entire drive may take several hours. The
erase time length is slightly longer than the time it takes to read the entire
drive. The SeaChest --deviceInfo command output has a line similar to this
example: 'Long Drive Self Test Time:  1 hour 38 minutes'. You can use the
reported time for your drive as being less than the time necessary to erase the
entire drive.

        --confirm I-understand-this-command-will-erase ... etc

        --setSectorSize [new sector size]        (Seagate Only)
                This option is only available for drives that support sector
                size changes. On SATA Drives, the Set Sector Configuration
                command must be supported. On SAS Drives, Fast Format must be
                supported. A format unit can be used on SAS instead of this
                option to perform a long format and adjust sector size. Use the
                --showSupportedSectorSizes option to see the sector sizes the
                drive reports supporting. If this option doesn't list anything,
                please consult your product manual. This option should be used
                to quickly change between 5xxE and 4xxx sector sizes. Using
                this option to change from 512 to 520 or similar is not
                recommended at this time due to limited drive support.

                This option can be used to quickly change the the logical
                sector size between 5xx emulation and 4xxx native logical block
                sizes. Resulting LBA (sector) count is either /8 or *8 the
                current Read Capacity or Identify, depending on the direction
                of the conversion.  In the case of SAS, this is a fast format
                unit command keeping existing data in the physical sector. The
                media may be readable, but data may be unspecified or may
                return errors on read access according to it's error processing
                algorithms. (See the help topic below: About FastFormat)

        --pattern [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue |
             file:filename]
                Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
                operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs or
                the whole drive.

                * repeat - without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
                hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This pattern
                will be repeated until it fills the logical size of the LBA.
                i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
                Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
                      unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be
                      given for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or
                      0000FFFFh

                * random - the entire logical sector size will be filled with
                random bytes. This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
                desired range.

                * increment - enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
                this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.

                * file - user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
                will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector
                size.
                Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
                Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
                        local directory.
                Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit
                        pattern. The file option will get truncated to a 32bit
                        pattern for SATA products.

        SAS Only:
        ========
        --formatUnit [current | new sector size]    (SAS Only) (Seagate Only)
                This option will start a format unit operation on a SAS drive
                Use "current" to perform a format unit operation with the
                Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector
                size to use upon format completion.

                Valid sector sizes are given by the --showSupportedSectorSizes
                command (see above) or  listed in the device Product Manual.
                This command will erase all data on the drive. The security
                initialize feature is not used and protection information will
                not be set. Combine this option with --poll or --progress to
                check for completion status until the format is complete.

                Warning: Once a Format Unit command is started it must be
                allowed to finish in order to calculate the total number of
                logical blocks (LBAs) at the finish.  If the sector size has
                changed then there will be a corresponding change to the total
                number of LBAs. If a device stops a Format Unit before it
                completes then the device will report a "Corrupted Format"
                sense code, "03-31".  Restart the format and allow it to finish
                to correct this error.

        --fastFormat [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)
                You must use this option with the --formatUnit option to run a
                fast format. Available fast format modes:
                    0 - This is a standard format unit command. All logical
                        blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a
                        very long time.
                    1 - This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
                        data in the physical sector. This option can be used to
                        quickly change the the logical sector size between 5xx
                        emulation and 4xxx native logical block sizes.
                        Resulting LBA (sector) count is either /8 or *8 the
                        current Read Capacity, depending on the direction of
                        the conversion.  The media may be readable, but data
                        may be unspecified or may return errors on read access
                        according to it's error processing algorithms.
                    2 - This is a fast format unit command that can change the
                        logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be
                        read accessible until a write has been performed to
                        the media.

                Example: --formatUnit 512 --fastFormat 1 --confirm I-... etc
                Example: --formatUnit 4096 --fastFormat 1 --confirm I-... etc

                Note: See the help topic below: About FastFormat

        --disableCertification       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to disable the certification operation when
                performing a format unit operation.

        --disablePrimaryList       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to disable using the primary defect list when
                performing a format unit operation.

        --discardGList       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to discard the existing grown defect list when
                performing a format unit operation. Set Complete List bit,
                this is the name of the bit in the format unit command. It
                means that a complete defect list was provided in the parameter
                data.  This tells the drive that whatever g-list it knows needs
                to be discarded and to use the one provided.  Because we are not
                giving a g-list, this means it discards the g-list and will
                rediscover the defects during the format.

        --disableImmediateResponse       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to disable the immediate response bit in a
                format unit operation.  This means that the format is run in
                the foreground and doesn't report any status until it is
                complete and cannot be polled.  Not commonly used.
                Note: This mode may take a long time to complete.

        --protectionIntervalExponent [exponent value]       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to specify the protection interval exponent for
                protection types 2 & 3. This option is ignored for all other
                protection types.

        --protectionType [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to specify the protection type to format the
                medium with.  Use with --formatUnit option.

                Protection type 0 = FMTPINFO=0 AND "Protection Field Usage"=0
                Protection type 1 = FMTPINFO=2 AND "Protection Field Usage"=0
                Protection type 2 = FMTPINFO=3 AND "Protection Field Usage"=0
                Protection type 3 = FMTPINFO=3 AND "Protection Field Usage"=1

                Note: Not all devices support protection types.

        --securityInitialize       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to set the security initialize bit in the
                initialization pattern for a format unit command. SBC
                recommends migrating to sanitize to overwrite previously
                reallocated sectors.
                Note: Not all products support this option.

        --stopOnListError       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to set the stop format bit in a format unit. If
                the device cannot locate or access an existing primary or grown
                defect list, the format will stop and return with an error.

        NVMe Only
        =========
        --nvmFormat [current | format # | sector size]  (NVMe Only)
                This option is used to start an NVM format operation. Use
                "current" to perform a format operation with the Sector size
                currently being used. If a value between 0 and 15 is given,
                then that will issue the NVM format with the specified sector
                size/metadata size for that supported format on the drive.
                Values 512 and higher will be treated as a new sector size to
                switch to and will be matched to an appropriate LBA format
                supported by the drive. This command will erase all data on the
                drive. Combine this option with --poll to poll for progress
                until the format is complete.

                HINT: Use --showSupportedFormats to print supported LBA Formats

        --nvmFmtSecErase [none | user | crypto]         (NVMe Only)
                This option is used to specify the type of erase to perform
                during an NVM format operation. All user data will be
                inaccessible upon completing format, no matter the erase
                requested.

                Options:
                     none   - no secure erase requested (previous data will not
                              be accessible)
                     user   - requests all user data is erased by the device.
                     crypto - requests a cryptographic erase of all user data.
                              Note: this mode is not supported on all devices.

        --nvmFmtMetadataSet [xlba | separate]   (NVMe Only)
                Use this option to specify how metadata is transmitted to
                the host system.
                Options:
                     xlba - metadata is transferred as part of the logical
                            block data
                     separate - metadata is transferred as a separate buffer

                Note: Not all devices support specifying this. If this option
                      is not provided, the NVM format will reuse the current
                      setting.

        --nvmFmtMS [# of bytes for metadata]    (NVMe Only)
                This option is used to specify the length of metadata with a
                requested logical block size. The device must support the
                combination of logical block size and metadata size or the
                format will be rejected by the device.

        --nvmFmtNSID [all | current]    (NVMe Only)
                This option changes the namespace ID (NSID) used when issuing
                the NVM format command. This can be used to control formatting
                device or a specific namespace if the device supports
                specifying specific namespaces for a format command. Not all
                devices support this behaviors no effect on devices that do not
                support targeting and will format the entire device.  If this
                option is not given, the format will be issued to all
                namespaces by default.

        --nvmFmtPI [0 | 1 | 2 | 3]      (NVMe Only)
                Use this option to specify the protection type to format the
                medium with.

                Note: Not all devices support protection types. If this option
                      is not provided, the NVM format will reuse the current
                      setting.

        --nvmFmtPIL [beginning | end]   (NVMe Only)
                Use this option to specify the location protection information
                in an NVM device's metadata.

                Note: Not all devices support specifying this. If this option
                      is not provided, the NVM format will reuse the current
                      setting.

About the SCSI Format Unit Command
==================================
(from the Seagate SCSI Commands Reference Manual, 100293068 Rev. H July 2014)
http://www.seagate.com/files/staticfiles/support/docs/manual/Interface%20manuals/100293068h.pdf

The FORMAT UNIT command requests that the device server format the medium into
application client accessible logical blocks as specified in the number of
blocks and block length values received in the last mode parameter block
descriptor in a MODE SELECT command. In addition, the device server may certify
the medium and create control structures for the management of the medium and
defects. The degree that the medium is altered by this command is
vendor-specific.

If a device server receives a FORMAT UNIT command before receiving a MODE
SELECT command with a mode parameter block descriptor the device server shall
use the number of blocks and block length at which the logical unit is
currently formatted (i.e., no change is made to the number of blocks and the
block length of the logical unit during the format operation).

The simplest form of the FORMAT UNIT command (i.e., a FORMAT UNIT command with
no parameter data) accomplishes medium formatting with little application
client control over defect management. The device server implementation
determines the degree of defect management that is to be performed. Additional
forms of this command increase the application client's control over defect
management.

The application client may specify:
  a) defect list(s) to be used;
  b) defect locations;
  c) that logical unit certification be enabled; and
  d) exception handling in the event that defect lists are not accessible.

While performing a format operation, the device server shall respond to
commands attempting to enter into the task set except INQUIRY commands, REPORT
LUNS commands, and REQUEST SENSE commands with CHECK CONDITION status with the
sense key set to NOT READY and the additional sense code set to LOGICAL UNIT
NOT READY, FORMAT IN PROGRESS. Handling of commands already in the task set is
vendor-specific. If the device server receives an INQUIRY command, a REPORT
LUNS commands, or a REQUEST SENSE command, then the device server shall process
the command. The device server shall return data for an INQUIRY command based
on the condition of the SCSI target device before beginning the FORMAT UNIT
command (i.e., INQUIRY data shall not change until after successful completion
of a format operation). The processing of commands in the task set when a
FORMAT UNIT command is received is vendor specific.

About FastFormat
================
A FastFormat (quickly changing the logical sector size) may take a few minutes
for the process to complete. The disk activity LED may show activity during the
conversion.  The larger the drive, the longer it takes.  This feature is found
on SAS and SATA interface Seagate drive families designed and manufactured
later than 2016.  SAS interface drives will report support for FastFormat if it
is available in the drive. Just run the -i or --deviceInfo command and check
under the Features Supported section.  Unfortunately, SATA interface drives do
not report this capability.  Please refer to the SATA product manual for
verification of this feature.

SAS and SATA interface drives accomplish a FastFormat this with the
--setSectorSize [new sector size] command found in SeaChest_Format or
SeaChest_Lite.  In addition, for SAS interface drives, only, the same result is
possible using the --formatUnit command with the --fastFormat [fast format
mode] modifier equal to 1.  This command is found in SeaChest_Format and
SeaChest_Erase.  For example:
--formatUnit 4096 --fastFormat 1 --confirm I-... etc

SAS interface drives, only, can all do a long format unit.  This procedure
takes a very long time, more than a day in some cases, but it does have the
advantage of full defect management with all sectors being readable at the
conclusion.  The fast format does not do this full drive read and
verification.  If your drive is new, there is no real need to run a long format
unit to change sector between 5xxE (512 bytes per logical sector emulation) and
4kN (4096 native bytes per sector, logical and physical).

NOTE: Operating systems do a device discovery during start up and set various
parameters, like total sectors and sector size, into the storage device
descriptions. The logical sector size times the number or logical sectors
defines the drive capacity.  You should expect to see OS I/O errors if you
change the logical sector size on a drive and then perform read or write
operations before the OS has updated its storage device descriptions.  Some
operating systems will throw an error after accessing a drive that has just run
a FastFormat but during its error recovery routines it may re-discover the
device parameters and update the system logs.  A system restart, however, is
the most reliable way to refresh the storage device descriptions.

 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_GenericTests diagnostic software.

One of the fundamental units of data on a storage device like a disk drive is
the sector.  In the case of a hard disk drive, a sector is a physical section
of a circular magnetized track accessed by read write heads over the rotating
media.  The original hard drive sectors are 512 bytes each.  If you take the
number or logical sectors on a disk drive and multiply it by 512 you get the
total capacity of the drive in bytes.  Since the mid-1990's the term sector has
been replaced by an acronym synonym LBA, which stands for Logical Block
Address.  All drives start with LBA 0 and count up to the full capacity of the
drive.

In the example above, the physical sector size is 512 bytes and logical sector
size is also 512 bytes.  Beginning around the year 2010 disk drives have been
manufactured with a physical sector size of 4096 bytes but the disk drive
delivers these bytes in 8 logical sectors of 512 bytes.  The operating system
expects 512 and is not concerned about the actual physical size.  These drives
are said to have 512 byte emulation.  Beginning in 2014, some enterprise drives
are manufactured with 4096 byte for both physical and logical block sizes.

SeaChest_GenericTests reads LBA and reports errors when an LBA is unreadable.

It may be possible to repair a problem when a generic read test fails due to
failure to read a particular sector (LBA).  You might consider the
--repairOnFly, --repairAtEnd or (SeaChest_SMART) -dstAndClean command line
options.  See the sections below "Sector Repair Commands" and "Bad LBA (Sector)
Found" for more information on this subject.

NOTE: SeaChest_GenericTests may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your Seagate storage
product. It includes several tests that will examine the physical media on your
Seagate, Samsung or Maxtor disk drive.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
SeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Inner and outer diameter tests refer to the physical beginning and ending
sections of a hard disk drive with rotating magnetic media.  In the case of SSD
devices, these tests refer to the logical beginning and ending sections of the
solid state drive.

Important note: Many tests in this tool directly reference storage device data
sectors, also known as Logical Block Addresses (LBA). Test arguments may
require a starting LBA or an LBA range.  The predefined variable 'maxLBA'
refers to the last sector on the drive.  Many older SATA and SAS storage
controllers (also known as Host Bus Adapters [HBA]) have a maximum addressable
limit of 4294967295 [FFFFh] LBAs hard wired into their design.  This equates to
2.1TB using 512 byte sectors.  This also means accessing an LBA beyond the
2.1TB limitation either will result in an error or simply the last readable LBA
(usually LBA 4294967295 [FFFFh]) depending on the actual hardware.  This
limitation can have important consequences.  For example, if you intended to
erase a 4TB drive, then only the first 2TB will actually get erased (or maybe
even twice!) and the last 2TB will remain untouched.  You should carefully
evaluate your system hardware to understand if your storage controllers provide
support for greater than 2.1TB.

        SeaChest_GenericTests [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_GenericTests --scan
        SeaChest_GenericTests -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_GenericTests -d /dev/sg1 --twoMinuteGeneric

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_GenericTests [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_GenericTests --scan
        SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD0 -i
        SeaChest_GenericTests -d PD1 --twoMinuteGeneric

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --bufferTest
                This option will perform a test using the device's echo buffer.
                The write buffer and read buffer commands are used to send &
                receive different data patterns.  The patterns are compared and
                interface CRC errors are also checked (when available).  Test
                patterns performed are all 0's, all F's, all 5's, all A's,
                walking 1's, walking 0's, and random data patterns.  At
                completion, a count of the number of errors will be displayed.

        --genericMode [ read | write (Seagate Only) | verify ]
                This options allows selection of the type of commands to use
                while performing a generic test.  If this option is omitted
                then read is the default mode.

                Supported modes are:
                  read -   performs a generic test using read commands, data safe
                  write -  performs a generic test using write commands, any
                           data on sectors written during the test will be
                           lost.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user
                           data. --confirm acknowledgment command will be
                           required. (Seagate Only)
                  verify - performs a generic test using verify commands, data
                           safe, sometimes faster than read commands.

        --shortGeneric
                This option will run a short generic read test on a specified
                device. A short generic read test has 3 components. A
                sequential read at the Outer Diameter (OD) of the drive for 1%
                the LBAs (sectors), then a sequential read at the Inner
                Diameter (ID) of the drive for 1% the LBAs, and lastly a random
                read of 5000 LBAs. This test will stop on the first read error
                that occurs.

        --twoMinuteGeneric
                This option will run a 2 minute generic read test on a
                specified device. There are 3 components to this test. A read
                at the Outer Diameter (OD) of the drive for 45 seconds, then a
                read at the Inner Diameter of the drive for 45 seconds, and
                lastly a random read test for 30 seconds. This test will stop
                on the first read error that occurs.

        --longGeneric
                This option will run a long generic read test on a specified
                device. A long generic read test sequentially reads every LBA
                on the device and gives a report of error LBAs at the end of
                the test, or when the error limit has been reached. Using the
                --stopOnError option will make this test stop on the first read
                error that occurs. The default error limit is 50 x number of
                logical sectors per physical sector.

                Example error limits are as follows:

                        512L/512P: error limit = 50
                        4096L/4096P: error limit = 50
                        512L/4096P: error limit = 400 (50 * 8)

        --userGenericStart [starting LBA | maxLBA]
                Use this option to specify the starting LBA number for a
                generic read test. The predefined text string "maxLBA" (without
                quotes) may be entered to indicate the last sector on the drive
                instead of the specific LBA number.  The --userGenericRange or
                timed (--hours, minutes, seconds) options must be used with
                this one in order to start the test. Use the --stopOnError
                repair flag and/or --errorLimit flags to further customize this
                test.

        --userGenericRange [LBA count]
                Use this option to specify the range for a generic read test.
                See the --userGenericStart help for additional information
                about using the User Generic Read tests.

        --diameterTest [O | M | I]
                Use this option to perform a generic read/write/verify test at
                the specified diameter of the drive. The different diameters
                can be combined or run individually. Use the time options to
                specify a time-based test or the --diameterTestRange option for
                a range-based test. If --diameterTestRange is omitted the
                default is a one minute test.

                    O - outer diameter
                    M - middle diameter
                    I - inner diameter

                Ex1: --diameterTest OMI
                Ex2: --diameterTest O
                Ex3: --diameterTest MI

        --diameterTestRange [range]
                Use this option with the --diameterTest option to perform a
                range based test. If a range is specified without any units, it
                is assumed to be an LBA count. Valid units are KB, KiB, MB,
                MiB, GB, GiB, TB and TiB.

                Ex1: "--diameterTestRange 1234567" for an LBA count
                Ex2: "--diameterTestRange 2GB" for a 2GB range.

        --stopOnError
                Use this option to make a generic read test stop on the first
                error found. Please see the section below "Sector Repair
                Commands".

        --errorLimit [limit in number of LBAs]
                Use this option to specify a different error limit for a user
                generic or long generic read test. This must be a number of
                logical LBAs to have errors. If a drive has multiple logical
                sectors per physical sector, this number will be adjusted for
                you to reflect the drive architecture.

        --randomTest
                Use this option to start a random read test. This is a timed
                operation. Use the time options to control how long to run this
                test. The default time for this test is 1 minute.  This test
                should be limited to 1 minute or less.

                Example: --randomTest --seconds 10

        --butterflyTest
                Use this option to start a butterfly read test.  A butterfly
                read test is a read test that moves back and forth between the
                OD and ID of the drive over and over again until the time has
                expired.  This is a timed operation. Use the time options to
                control how long to run this test. The default time for this
                test is 1 minute.  This test should be limited to 1 minute
                or less.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --hideLBACounter
                Use this option to supress the output from options that show
                LBA counters without turning off all output to the screen.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --hours [hours]
                Use this option to specify a time in hours for a timed
                operation to run.

        --minutes [minutes]
                Use this option to specify a time in minutes for a timed
                operation to run.

        --seconds [seconds]
                Use this option to specify a time in seconds for a timed
                operation to run.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

======================
Bad LBA (Sector) Found
======================
IMPORTANT: Please read and carefully consider all of the following information
about your "Bad LBA (Logical Block Address, or Sector) Found" options.

A bad sector is a small 512-byte area on the disk drive that is reporting
errors and cannot be accessed properly. New bad sectors, sometimes called grown
defects, are often caused by some kind of physical damage. If a file or folder
uses this sector, then the file is already incomplete or corrupt because the
bytes are not readable.

**** NOTE **** The following information applies only to Seagate Technology,
Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie brand disk drives:

When SeaChest discovers a bad LBA (sector) through reading, it displays a count
of the bad sectors.

Sectors are often not in use. If a sector is in use, then that file is
incomplete or corrupt. When a bad sector happens to align with a folder or
directory listing structure, then the links to files and sub-folders it manages
may be broken.

You should carefully consider the importance of your data. While the sector is
currently unreadable, if the file or folder is important to you then you may
need professional recovery services to possibly reclaim the data. In this case,
select to scan without trying to repair sectors on the drive.

If you have decided that the file or folder is replaceable, already backed up
or just not important to you, then you can tell SeaChest to attempt to attempt
to repair the sector.  See the Sector Repair Commands section above.

By design, modern disk drives maintain spare sectors for reallocation purposes.
Usually, sectors become difficult to read long before they become impossible to
read. In this situation the actual data bytes in the sector are preserved and
transferred to the new spare during a sector reallocation. Similarly, when a
disk drive writes data and encounters a problem, the drive firmware retires the
problem sector and activates a replacement before giving successful write
status.

If you give permission to attempt to repair a bad sector, then SeaChest will
attempt to write a 512-byte pattern of zeros to that single error sector.
Usually, this action will assist the disk drive firmware in managing the
problem by retiring the problem sector and activating a spare in its place. If
the attempted repair fails to reallocate the LBA to an available spare, then
the test is a FAIL and the drive is bad.

Note: Seagate Technology is not responsible for lost user data.

 SeaChest_Info Version: 1.5.0
 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Info diagnostic software.

Disk drives are constantly monitoring and analyzing their own performance,
integrity and environment.  The current state of this technology is the result
of more than 20 years of innovative Seagate engineering focused on self-testing.

With the backing of personal computer manufacturers, the disk drive industry
adopted an analysis system in the 1990's called Self Monitoring Analysis and
Reporting Technology, or SMART. The idea then and today is to predict a failure
before it happens. Various attributes are being monitored and measured against
certain threshold limits. If any one attribute exceeds a threshold then a
general SATA SMART Status test will change from Pass to Fail.

Many computers automatically check SATA SMART Status when they start up which is
when most people become aware of the issue. If still under warranty, then SMART
Status FAIL is a valid condition for warranty replacement.

You can use SeaChest_Basics or SeaChest_SMART software with --smartCheck to
test the SATA SMART status of the drive.

When a SMART Status test has a FAIL it is extremely important that you back up
all of your important data. SMART Status FAIL is a near-term prediction of
drive failure and the drive usually functions like normal. Unfortunately, there
is no way to specifically predict when the failure will occur, so your best
response is to back up your data as soon as possible.

SMART attributes are also supplemented by SATA Device Statistics Notification
(DSN) feature set, including a set of Device Statistics Notifications log
pages.  This data provides further insight into a drive's performance and can
be used to help measure its usage and potentially identify problem areas of
concern.

Likewise, SAS SCSI and FibreChannel interface products collect ongoing
performance data and save this information in many different "vital data" and
"log" pages.  This data is similar and overlaps most of the same data
collection categories as the SATA interface.

SeaChest does not interpret attributes or thresholds.  As a practical matter,
the technology supporting SMART is constantly being improved.  Each new design
incorporates improvements that increase the accuracy of the SMART prediction.
As a matter of policy, Seagate does not publish attributes and thresholds.
Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Info.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your Seagate storage
product. It includes several tests that will examine the physical media on your
Seagate, Samsung or Maxtor disk drive.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
SeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Usage - Linux
=============
        SeaChest_Info [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_Info --scan
        SeaChest_Info -d /dev/sg2 -i

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_Info [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_Info --scan
        SeaChest_Info -d PD0 -i

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

       -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --csmiInfo
                Use this option to show some information reported by the CSMI
                compliant driver. This includes driver information, controller
                information, PHY information, SAS address, and SATA signature
                as they were reported by the driver. This information can be
                useful when troubleshooting CSMI system/driver compatibility
                issues.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --deviceStatistics
                Use this option to display the device statistics reported by
                the device. On SATA, this uses the Device Statistics log, and
                the notifications log (if DSN feature is supported) to display
                these statistics. On SAS, various log pages are read to collect
                a bunch of equivalent reported parameter information.

        SATA Only:
        =========
        --smartAttributes [raw | analyzed]   (SATA only)
                The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
                Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
                vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
                always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
                used to determine a warranty return. Use the --smartCheck
                command found in SeaChest_SMART to determine if one of the
                warranty attributes has been tripped. Seagate Support does not
                help to analyze SMART attributes.

        SAS Only:
        =========
        --showSCSIDefects [ p | g | pg ]        (SAS Only)
                This option will display the SCSI defects on the screen. The
                arguments to this will tell whether to get the grown, primary,
                or primary and grown defects from the drive. Use the
                --defectFormat option to specify the mode to display the
                defects. If no mode is specified, physical cylinder-head-sector
                mode is assumed.

                Arguments:
                p - use this option to pull and display the primary (factory)
                    defects
                g - use this option to pull and display the grown (reallocated)
                    defects
                pg - the options can be combined to pull and display both
                    defect lists.

        --defectFormat [ # | shortBlock | longBlock | xbfi | xchs | bfi | chs ] (SAS Only)
                This option set the format of the defects to output. Not all
                drives will support all defect modes. SSDs will only support
                block modes.

                Arguments: show the defects in either name or # mode
                shortBlock | 0    short block address mode (drives < 32bit LBA)
                xbfi       | 1    extended bytes from index mode
                xchs       | 2    extended physical cylinder-head-sector mode
                longBlock  | 3    long block address mode (drives > 32bit LBA)
                bfi        | 4    bytes from index mode
                chs        | 5    physical cylinder-head-sector mode

                Examples: --defectFormat 3, or --defectFormat longBlock

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_PowerControl diagnostic software.

Optimization within the framework of a complex company data center requires
dynamic technology. As storage capacity demands increase due to virtualization
and growing volumes of data, managing power usage in an intelligent way is
critical for reducing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

There are, roughly, three general frameworks for disk drive power management.
The earlier specification is part of Advanced Power Management (APM) which
provided controls over many devices in a system, including disk drives.  APM
has since been replaced by a new framework called Extended Power Controls
(EPC).  Seagate's implementation of EPC began to phase in starting in 2010 and
is named by the marketing term "PowerChoice".  Seagate PowerChoice
technologyspecifically developed for enterprise environmentsoffers more
energy efficiency and control over the amount of power hard drives consume.

You may need to learn what capabilities for power management your drive offers,
such as supporting APM or EPC, and maybe both.  See the commands
--showEPCSettings or --showAPMLevel(SATA Only) or --deviceInfo for various
reports containing power settings and features supported.  Most enterprise
drives after 2016 only support EPC (PowerChoice).

PowerChoice technology improves on earlier technology and allows for
energy-saving during periods of command inactivity, allowing for greater power
reductions. As idle time increases, the power-saving benefits also increase,
and the drives will still quickly respond to commands even after long idling
periods. In addition, PowerChoice technology supports four customizable modes
to give businesses significantly more control of power usage by allowing for up
to a 54% reduction in the amount of energy used.

See the section below "How PowerChoice Technology Works"

The third and newest drive power management framework exists for SATA drives
and is named PowerBalance.  Seagate's PowerBalance feature will adjust drive
performance during random operations to reduce power consumption of the drive.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the status of your Seagate storage product.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
SeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        SeaChest_PowerControl -d PD0 -i
        SeaChest_PowerControl -d PD1 --deviceInfo

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge. To see the child drive
                details add --usbChildInfo to the command line options.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --checkPowerMode
                Get the current power mode of a drive. On SCSI devices, this
                will only work if the drive has transitioned from active state
                to another state.  In Windows, the --checkPowerMode command
                will always wake up SATA drives which are controlled by the
                default Microsoft drivers.  This means you cannot check the
                power mode and determine that it is in Idle or Standby. Drives
                on secondary controllers or non-Microsoft device drivers may
                accept the --checkPowerMode command without waking up the drive.

        --spinDown
                Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby
                Immediate for SATA, or standby_z for SAS. Use this before
                moving a hard disk drive. The drive will spin back up if the
                operating system selects the drive. This means that an active
                drive will not stay spun down.

                In the case of SSD devices, the drive will flush the temporary
                caches and prepare for shutdown.

        --idle
                This command will transition a drive to the idle power state.
                This command may flush the cache before the transition to this
                state.  This command is for non-EPC enabled drives. If the
                drive has the EPC feature enabled, it is recommended that the
                --transitionPower option be used instead. This option is
                compatible with EPC enabled drives as well, but offers less
                control over the transition. If the operating system selects
                this drive, it will transition it back to an active state.

        --idleUnload
                This command will transition a drive to the idle, heads
                unloaded, power state. This command may flush the cache before
                the transition to this state.  This command is for non-EPC
                enabled drives.  If the drive has the EPC feature enabled, it
                is recommended that the --transitionPower option be used
                instead. This option is compatible with EPC enabled drives as
                well, but offers less control over the transition. If the
                operating system selects this drive, it will transition it back
                to an active state.

        --standby
                This command will transition a drive to the standby power
                state.  This command will flush the cache before the transition
                to this state.  This command is for non-EPC enabled drives. If
                the drive has the EPC feature enabled, it is recommended that
                the --transitionPower option be used instead. This option is
                compatible with EPC enabled drives as well, but offers less
                control over the transition.  On an HDD, this will cause the
                spindle motor to stop.  If the operating system selects this
                drive, it will transition it back to an active state.

        --active
                This command will transition a drive to the active power state.
                This uses a ATA read-verify command to a random LBA, or a SCSI
                start-stop unit command.

        --showEPCSettings
                Use this option to show the current Extended Power Conditions
                (EPC) settings on the screen. Only drives supporting the EPC
                feature will show this data and only supported power conditions
                will be shown.

        --EPCfeature [enable | disable]
                Enables or disables Extended Power Conditions (EPC) support for
                devices.  To disable EPC use --EPCfeature disable. Note that the
                EPC Feature Set is not supported on all devices. Use
                --deviceInfo option to see if EPC is supported.

        --changePower
                Use this option to enable or disable certain --powerMode and
                their timers. You can also use this option to restore default
                values to the drive. The available power modes are idle_a,
                idle_b, idle_c, standby_y (SAS only), standby_z, or all. "all"
                can only be used to enable/disable/default everything. It
                cannot be used to set a timer. Timer values are specified in
                milliseconds.

                Example restore: --changePower --defaultMode --powerMode idle_a
                Example enable: --changePower --enableMode --powerMode idle_a
                Example set timer: --changePower --enableMode --powerMode idle_a
                                   --modeTimer 5000

        --enableMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to enable
                a specific --powerMode.

        --modeTimer [timer value in milliseconds]
                Use this option to specify a timer value to use with the
                --changePower mode option.

        --disableMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to disable
                a specific --powerMode.

        --defaultMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to restore
                the default settings for a specific --powerMode.  The "all"
                option is only valid for SAS interface drives.

        --transitionPower
                Use this option to actively change --powerMode. The available
                power modes are idle_a, idle_b, idle_c, standby_y (SAS only),
                standby_z, or active (SAS only).

                Note: Hard disk drives require a few seconds time to spin up or
                down. The drive will report the old power mode until it is
                fully established in the new mode.  The SeaChest --spinDown
                command is similar.  On SAS --spinDown is equivalent to Motor
                Stop and --transitionPower --powerMode active is equivalent to
                Motor Start.

                Example: --transitionPower --powerMode idle_a
                Example: --transitionPower --powerMode standby_y

        --powerMode [powermode]
                Use this option to specify a power mode. This should be used
                with the --changePower or --transitionPower options.
                Valid power modes (SAS and SATA):
                        idle_a
                        idle_b
                        idle_c
                        standby_y (SAS only)
                        standby_z
                        active (SAS only, used with --trasitionPower)
                        all (used with --changePower enable, disable or default)
                Valid power modes (NVMe): 0 - 30

        SATA Only
        =========
        --showAPMLevel   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to show the current Advanced Power Management
                (APM) level of a device

        --setAPMLevel [1 - 254]   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to set the APM level of a device. Valid values
                are between 1 and 254.  This setting is non-volatile so it
                holds across power cycles.
                      1 = Minimum power consumption with standby mode
                  2-127 = Intermediate power management with standby mode
                    128 = Minimum power consumption without standby mode
                129-253 = Intermediate power management without standby mode
                    254 = Maximum Performance

        --disableAPM   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to disable the current Advanced Power Management (APM) level of a device

        --powerBalanceFeature [info | enable | disable]   (SATA Only)(Seagate Only)
                Use this option to see the state of the Seagate PowerBalance
                feature or to change its state. Seagate's PowerBalance feature
                will adjust drive performance during random operations to
                reduce power consumption of the drive.
                    info - will display the state of the PowerBalance feature
                           on the screen
                    enable - use this to enable PowerBalance
                    disable - use this to disable PowerBalance
                Note: SAS products should use the --setPowerConsumption option
                instead.

        --sataDAPSfeature [info | enable | disable ]    (SATA Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the SATA Device Automatic
                Partial To Slumber Transitions (DAPS) feature. Use the "info"
                option to see the current state of the DIPM feature on the
                device. The use of this feature requires that the DIPM feature
                is enabled.

                NOTE: Please ensure that the host adapter/controller/driver can
                handle this before enabling it, otherwise the drive link may go
                down and the device will not be able to communicate.

        --sataDIPMfeature [info | enable | disable ]    (SATA Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the SATA Device Initiated
                Power Management (DIPM) feature. Use the "info" option to see
                the current state of the DIPM feature on the device.

                NOTE: Please ensure that the host adapter/controller/driver can
                handle this before enabling it, otherwise the drive link may go
                down and the device will not be able to communicate.

        SAS Only
        ========
        --showPowerConsumption  (SAS Only)
                This option will show the power consumption rates supported by
                the device and the current power consumption rate of the
                device. Use a supported watt value with the
                --setPowerConsumption option to set the power consumption to
                that value.

        --setPowerConsumption [default | highest | intermediate | lowest |
          watt value]   (SAS Only) (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the power consumption rate of the device
                to the value input.
                Options:
                        default - sets the device back to default settings

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

How PowerChoice Technology Works
================================
See the Seagate technology paper "Seagate PowerChoice Technology Provides
Unprecedented Hard Drive Power Savings and Flexibility"
http://www.seagate.com/files/docs/pdf/en-GB/whitepaper/tp608-powerchoice-tech-provides-gb.pdf

Each individual power condition builds on the capabilities of the previous
higher power condition in order to save incrementally more power. The specific
energy-saving steps implemented for each power condition are as follows:

Idle_A
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Discs rotating at full speed (7,200 RPM)
Idle_B
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Discs rotating at full speed (7,200 RPM)
Idle_C/Standby_Y (SAS Only)
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Drive speed reduced to a lower RPM (reduced RPM)
Standby_Z
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Drive motor is spun down.
        - Drive still responds to non-media access host commands.

Flexibility is a key feature of PowerChoice technology, enabling commands from
the host side to customize power condition settings and direct a drive into or
out of power conditions as required. Two different options are available for
the user to modify PowerChoice technology settings, depending on the interface
used:

SAS
        Host-definable timers via mode pages
        Immediate host-commanded power transitions via Start/Stop Unit (SSU)
        command
SATA
        Host-definable timers via Set Features commands
        Immediate host-commanded power transitions via Set Features commands

Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Security diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Security is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
configure, change or set various properties on Seagate disk drives (this
includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie).  Some commands may cause existing
data on the drive to become inaccessible.  Some commands may affect the
performance of the drive.

References are made to TCG (Trusted Computing Group), a standards organization
formed to promote open standards for hardware-enabled security technologies.
You can read about TCG at http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/ and

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --displayLBA [LBA | maxLBA]
                This option will read and display the contents of the specified
                LBA to the screen. The display format is hexadecimal with an
                ASCII translation on the side (when available).  The predefined
                text string "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to
                indicate the last sector on the drive instead of the specific
                LBA number.

        --tcgInfo
                This option shows information about a TCG device. Displays
                drive 'Use State'.

        --fwdlPort [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the logical firmware download port on a
                TCG drive to the requested state. Use the --sid option to
                provide SID for this operation. If SID is not provided, MSID
                will be used.
                    lock - lock the port and prevent its use
                    unlock - unlock the port to allow its use

        --udsPort [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the logical UDS port on a TCG drive to the
                requested state. Use the --sid option to provide SID for this
                operation. If SID is not provided, MSID will be used.
                    lock - lock the port and prevent its use
                    unlock - unlock the port to allow its use

        --ieee1667Port [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the logical IEEE 1667 port on a TCG drive
                to the requested state. Use the --sid option to provide SID for
                this operation. If SID is not provided, MSID will be used.
                    lock - lock the port and prevent its use
                    unlock - unlock the port to allow its use

                Note: This command may not run under Windows 10 and above unless
                      the drive supports various preconditions in firmware.
                      Linux should work without preconditions.

        --psid [32-digit alpha numeric code from drive label]
                This option can be used to specify the value of the PSID.
                This may be required in order to perform certain TCG
                operations.

                The PSID (Physical Security IDentification number) is a
                32-digit number & capital letter sequence printed on the label.
                There is no electronic query for this number, therefore the
                drive must be removed in order to read the PSID number.  Many
                drives have a PSID code on the label but are NOT marked as
                "Seagate Secure"; these drives do not support revertSP
                cryptographic erase.

                Enter the PSID without spaces. FIVE attempts are allowed before
                a power cycle is required. It can also be read by 2D barcode
                reader. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults.

                Example: --revertSP --psid 123ALL32DIGITS123ALL32DIGITS123A

        --sid [yourTCGpassword]
                This option can be used to specify the value of SID. This may
                be required in order to perform certain TCG operations. If this
                is not provided, MSID will be used.  As a practical matter, if
                you have implemented TCG boot authentication software tools,
                then the actual password may be completely different from the
                drive's point of view.  In other words, software and BIOS tools
                commonly run hash algorithms or use keyboard scan codes as
                added security instead of plain ASCII characters when saving
                drive passwords.

                You may need to cryptographically erase all data on the drive
                with --revertSP to clear the existing SID before the
                lock|unlock options can be set before installing the operating
                system and user data.  You should consult you TCG software
                vendor for instruction and advice about disabling or removing
                the SID before erasing your data.

                If the SID or MSID are not set (such as a new drive) then the
                various lock|unlock commands won't need the --sid option.

                Example: --revert --sid yourTCGpassword

        --disableDataLocking (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to disable data locking on a TCG drive.
                This option is only available when the drive has not had
                SID changed (taken ownership). This prevents locking the
                drive when it isn't being used with security software.
                Once this operation is completed, you will not be able to
                authenticate to SID as MSID. This can be undone with a revertSP
                Note: Not all Enterprise TCG drives support this feature or
                they may need a firmware update to enable this capability

        --showLockedRegions
                Use this option to show the locked ranges or bands on TCG Opal
                or TCG Enterprise SED drives.

SATA Only
---------
        --ataSATsecurityProtocol [enable | disable]         (SATA only)
                This option can be used to force enable or disable using the
                ATA security protocol as specified in the SAT specification. By
                default, the tool will use this method when it is supported to
                allow the SATL to understand and manage the security commands
                being performed and prevent other issues.

                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If a drive
                lost power during an ATA Security Erase in SeaChest, then using
                the password SeaChest with type 'user' will remove the temporary
                password set by the utility.

                Example:
                --ataSATsecurityProtocol disable --ataSecPassword SeaChest --ataSecPassType user

                Some commands like --scan and --deviceInfo will still run on a
                locked drive. To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS
                must have set the password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash
                the password typed in the configuration however it chooses and
                this utility has no idea how to match what the BIOS has done so
                it may not always work to remove a password set by something
                other than this utility. See the --ataSecPWMod command below
                for additional alternatives.

        --ataSecPassword ["ASCII password" | SeaChest | empty]      (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify a password to use with an ATA
                security operation. If specifying a password with spaces,
                quotes must be used. If SeaChest is given, the default SeaChest
                password will be used. If empty is given, an empty password
                will be used.

                Examples:
                  "This is a valid password"
                  ThisIsAlsoValid
                  "This password uses \"quotes\"
                  "This password is \/\/eird"

                Note: Windows PE offers an ATA Security Erase feature. If the
                erase is interrupted then a temporary password
                AutoATAWindowsString12345678901 is still set.

                Note: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        --ataSecPassType [user | master]                (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify if the password being given with the
                --ataSecPassword option is a user or a master password. If this
                option is not provided, user is assumed.

        --ataSecPWMod [byteswapped | zeropad | spacepad | fpad | leftAlign |
          rightAlign | uppercase | lowercase | invertcase] (SATA Only)
                Use this option to have the utility make modifications to the
                ATA security password to attempt other various ways it may be
                sent by a system bios. These are not guaranteed to work, but
                may help unlock a drive that was locked by a BIOS that encoded
                the password in a unique way. This option can be presented
                multiple times to select multiple modifications.

                EX: --ataSecPWMod byteswapped --ataSecPWMod invertcase
                  byteswapped - byteswaps the password. EX: blah -> lbha
                  zeropad - zero pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  spacepad - space pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  fpad - pads the passwords with Fh (all 1's) if less than
                     32characters
                  leftAlign - left aligns the password in the buffer
                  rightAlign - right aligns the password in the buffer
                  uppercase - sends the password as all uppercase
                  lowercase - sends the password as all lowercase
                  invertcase - switches uppercase for lower, and lowercase for
                  upper

        --ataSecFreeze          (SATA only)
                This option will send the ATA security freezelock command to a
                device. This command prevents all other ATA security commands
                from being processed until the next reset or power cycle.

        --ataSecurityInfo               (SATA only)
                This option shows information about the ATA security feature on
                ATA devices. It will show the security state and flags related
                to the state, Master password capability & ID, time to perform
                a secure erase, whether user data is encrypted, and whether
                sanitize can override ATA security to repurpose a drive.

        --disableATASecPW               (SATA Only)
                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If the
                drive is in high security mode, either user or master password
                may be provided. In maximum security mode only the user
                password can be provided to unlock and disable the ATA security
                password. The master may only be used to erase the drive in
                maximum security mode. Use the --ataSecPassword option to
                provide the password to use and --ataSecPassType to specify
                whether it is the user or master password.

                If a drive lost power during an ATA Security Erase in
                SeaChest_Security, then providing --ataSecPassword SeaChest
                will use the default SeaChest password used during the erase.
                To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS must have set the
                password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash or modify the
                password typed in the configuration however it chooses and this
                utility has no idea how to match what the BIOS has done so it
                may not always work to remove a password set by something other
                than this utility.

        --unlockATASec          (SATA only)
                Use this option along with the --ataSecPassword option and
                --ataSecPassType option to unlock a drive with the provided
                password.  If the drive is in maximum security mode, only the
                user password may be used to unlock the device.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        --confirm this-command-will-erase-data ... etc

        --revert
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification Revert on a Self Encrypting
                Drive (SED). This operation is only available on Seagate TCG
                Opal drives. Seagate SED drives are marked on the label with
                the words "Seagate Secure".  No all Seagate SED drives are TCG
                Opal compliant.

                In order to complete this operation, the lockingSP must not be
                activated, as this option will activate it in order to perform
                the revert. The value of SID, must also be the value of MSID as
                this operation must authenticate as SID using the value of
                MSID. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults. If this operation fails, use
                --revertSP instead.

                Example: --revert --sid yourTCGpassword

        --revertSP
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification revertSP on a Self
                Encrypting Drive (SED). This operation is available on all
                Seagate SED drives which may be marked on the label with the
                word "SED". Requires the --psid code from the label.

                Note: To determine if your drive supports cryptographic erase
                you can run --tcgInfo --deviceInfo (look for 'Encryption
                Support: Self Encrypting' and 'TCG'.

                Example: --revertSP --psid 123ALL32DIGITS123ALL32DIGITS123A
                Note: If a Secure product does not recognize the --revertSP
                --psid combination, try --revert --psid as the two commands are
                closely related.

==============================
Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
==============================
Abstract
--------
The SeaChest_Erase --revert and --revertSP commands require specific support be
enabled in the Linux kernel.  This document describes the process to enable
support for sending ATA Trusted Trusted Computing Group (TCG) commands in
Linux. The focus is on how to do this through Ubuntu Linux 14.04LTS, however,
the process should apply to other Linuxs as well although others may vary
slightly.

Modifying The GRUB Configuration File (Ubuntu example used)
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to make the change to allow TCG commands persist across reboots, you
must modify the kernel boot parameters. In Ubuntu, this is accomplished by
modifying the GRUB 2 configuration file. This section references the Grub2
configuration documentation from the Ubuntu Community:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup#Configuring_GRUB_2

Follow these steps to perform this modification in Ubuntu (other Linuxs may be
similar).

1. You must modify the file /etc/default/grub. You can do this by running "sudo
gedit /etc/default/grub"

2. Once this file is open in the editor of your choice, add
"libata.allow_tpm=1" to the line  that begins with "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT"
(or which ever line in grub is the one you use to boot your kernel, but this is
the default).

3. Close your editor

4. Run the command "sudo update-grub" to apply your changes to the grub boot
configuration (the file modified in these steps is a config file for the config
file).

5. Restart your computer to make this active

Temporarily Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
------------------------------------------
You can temporarily enable TCG commands without modifying the kernel boot
parameters. This can be accomplished by modifying the libata parameters file.
Below is a sample script that can be run to do this.

Sample Script:

cd /sys/module/libata/parameters
sudo chmod 644 allow_tpm
echo 1 | sudo dd of=./allow_tpm
sudo chmod 444 allow_tpm

Tiny Core - Enabling TCG Commands
------------------------------------------
Follow these steps to enable TCG commands on a Tiny Core bootable USB flash
drive.

1. Leave the USB flash drive in after you run the Windows-based USB boot maker
tool.

2. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/boot/syslinux.cfg and in there, add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the append line with the other kernel boot parameters.

3. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/EFI/boot/refind.conf and add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the options line with the other kernel boot parameters

Alternate method:
If Linux is already booted and you only want to temporarily enable TCG
commands, you can change the contents of
/sys/module/libata/parameters/allow_tpm from "0" to a "1".

 SeaChest_SMART Version: 1.12.0
 Build Date: June 10 2019
===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_SMART diagnostic software.

Disk drives are constantly monitoring and analyzing their own performance,
integrity and environment.  The current state of this technology is the result
of more than 20 years of innovative Seagate engineering focused on self-testing.

With the backing of personal computer manufacturers, the disk drive industry
adopted an analysis system in the 1990's called Self Monitoring Analysis and
Reporting Technology, or SMART. The idea then and today is to predict a failure
before it happens. Various attributes are being monitored and measured against
certain threshold limits. If any one attribute exceeds a threshold then a
general SATA SMART Status test will change from Pass to Fail.

Many computers automatically check SMART Status when they start up which is
when most people become aware of the issue. If still under warranty, then SMART
Status FAIL is a valid condition for warranty replacement.

You can use SeaChest_SMART software with --smartCheck to test the SATA SMART
status of the drive.

When a SMART Status test has a FAIL it is extremely important that you back up
all of your important data. SMART Status FAIL is a near-term prediction of
drive failure and the drive usually functions like normal. Unfortunately, there
is no way to specifically predict when the failure will occur, so your best
response is to back up your data as soon as possible.

SeaChest does not interpret attributes or thresholds.  As a practical matter,
the technology supporting SMART is constantly being improved.  Each new design
incorporates improvements that increase the accuracy of the SMART prediction.
As a matter of policy, Seagate does not publish attributes and thresholds.
Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.

In addition, the SMART command set includes short and long Drive Self Test
(Offline Immediate).

Seagate drives employ a background media scan (BGMS) during idle activity
times.  The BGMS is a sequential read of sectors from the beginning to the end
the of the drive.  If BGMS is interrupted it later restarts where it left off.
BGMS has no effect on performance.  BGMS collects information about
"suspicious" sectors.  When the Short DST is run the first step is a review of
these "suspicious" sectors.  It is possible for Short DST to fail quickly if
one of these BGMS sectors is unreadable.

It may be possible to repair a problem when Short DST fails due to failure to
read a particular sector (LBA).  You might consider the --seagateClean or
-dstAndClean command line options.  See the sections below "Sector Repair
Commands" and "Bad LBA (Sector) Found" for more information on this subject.

If you wish to test the drive for physical integrity, please use Short Drive
Self Test (--shortDST).  Because the BGMS has continuously collected
information on the entire drive, Short DST is effectively testing the entire
drive.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_SMART.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the health and status of your Seagate storage
product. It includes several tests that will examine the physical media on your
Seagate, Samsung or Maxtor disk drive.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
SeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        SeaChest_SMART [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_SMART --scan
        SeaChest_SMART -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_SMART -d /dev/sg1 --shortDST --poll

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_SMART [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_SMART --scan
        SeaChest_SMART -d PD0 -i
        SeaChest_SMART -d PD1 --shortDST --poll

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --poll
                Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
                until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
                command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
                and the final test result.  Full drive procedures will take a
                very long time.  Used with --shortDST and --longDST.

        --shortDST
                Execute a short diagnostic drive self test. This test can take
                up to 2 minutes to complete.  Use with the --poll argument to
                let SeaChest check for progress and print it to the screen
                until complete.  If the --poll argument is not used then the
                test begins and immediately returns to the command prompt.  Use
                the --progress DST command to check on the completion
                percentage (%) and test result. The poll argument does not
                return to the command prompt and prints ongoing completion
                percentages (%) until the final test result.

                Note: Use --progress DST or --showDSTLog to see details about
                the last DST run on the drive.

        --longDST
                Execute a long diagnostic drive self test. This test takes
                hours to finish. A 2TB drive may take six (6) hours to
                complete. The start argument begins the test and immediately
                returns to the command prompt.  Use the --progress DST command
                to check on the completion percentage (%) and test result. The
                poll argument does not return to the command prompt and prints
                ongoing completion percentages (%) and the final test result.

                This test stops on the first error. Use --abortDST to manually
                stop the test. SAS drives give status in 1% increments. SATA
                drives give status in 10% increments which means more than an
                hour may elapse between updates on a SATA drive >2TB.

                Because of the extreme length of time required to run the Long
                DST command on a large disk drive an additional command line
                argument is required as confirmation of your understanding that
                the test will take a very long time to complete.

                Note: The SeaChest --deviceInfo command output has a line
                similar to this example: 'Long Drive Self Test Time:  1 hour 38
                minutes'.

                If the --longDST poll option is running and you want to abort
                the test then you will need to open a second terminal window
                and run the --abortDST command.  Otherwise, it is safe to
                restart the system while long DST is running which also ends the
                test.

        --progress [DST]
                Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default).
                Specify a test with: DST to check progress. The progress counts
                up from 0% to 100%.

        --abortDST
                Abort a diagnostic Drive Self Test that is in progress.

        --smartCheck
                Perform a SMART check on a device to see if any internal
                thresholds have been tripped or if the drive is still operating
                within specification.

        --idd [short | long]    (Seagate Only)
                Start an In Drive Diagnostic (IDD) test on a Seagate SATA
                drive. Not all tests are supported by all products. If a
                selected test is not supported, the utility will return
                an error code meaning "not supported".

                short:   Reset and Recalibration test. Be careful running this
                         test on the boot device.
                long:   Test G list and P list for readability.
                repair:  Reset and Recalibration test and test G list and
                         P list and attempt to repair or reallocate bad
                         sectors.

                Add --poll to the command line to see periodic status during
                the test.  Otherwise, use --progress DST after 60 seconds to
                allow the drive time to spin back up after the recalibration
                test.

                Example: --idd short --poll

        --abortIDD (Seagate Only)
                Abort a Seagate In Drive Diagnostic (IDD) that is in progress.

        --errorLimit [limit in number of LBAs]
                Use this option to specify a different error limit for DST and
                Clean. This must be a number of logical LBAs to have errors. If
                a drive has multiple logical sectors per physical sector, this
                number will be adjusted for you to reflect the drive
                architecture.

        SATA Only:
        =========
        --conveyanceDST (SATA Only)
                Execute a conveyance diagnostic drive self test. A conveyance
                test can be used to check if a drive has incurred handling
                damage. This test can take up to 2 minutes to complete. Use the
                --poll argument to make this operation poll for progress until
                complete. Use the --progress dst command to check on the
                completion percentage (%) and test result.

        --captive or --foreground (SATA Only)
                Use this option to run a DST operation in captive/foreground
                mode. This mode may allow a device to test more of itself and
                may be slightly faster than offline/background mode since it
                does not need to service additional command during the test.
                When using this mode, the utility must wait the entire time for
                the DST or IDD to complete and progress cannot be indicated
                during this time.

        --showDSTLog (SATA Only)
                This option will show the entries in the DST log. Up to 21
                entries may be shown (pending drive support) and will be shown
                with the most recent entry first.

        --smartInfo (SATA Only)
                This option will show SMART information reported by a given
                device.

        --smartFeature [enable | disable]            (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the SMART feature on a
                SATA drive.  When disabled, the entire SMART feature set, minus
                the enable command, is turned off.  This includes all SMART
                logging, attributes, SMART trip ability, and DST ability.
                Note: This command is declared obsolete in ACS4.

        --smartAttributes [raw | analyzed]           (SATA Only)
                The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes.
                Some attributes names are commonly standard and most others are
                vendor unique. In either case, the attribute thresholds are
                always vendor unique. Most attributes are informational and not
                used to determine a warranty return. Use the --smartCheck
                command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been
                tripped. Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART
                attributes.

        --smartAttributeAutosave [enable | disable]  (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable SMART attribute auto-save
                on an ATA drive.  This is the drive's ability to update the
                attributes on it's own without the "update attributes" command.
                By default, this is enabled and on new drives may just be a
                no-op.
                Note: This command is declared obsolete in ACS4.

        --smartAutoOffline [enable | disable]  (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable SMART auto-offline feature
                on an ATA drive.  This command was never officially adopted by
                ATA committee, but was in the original SMART spec from
                Compaq/HP. This allows the drive to do an offline scan on it's
                own. This is not quite a background media scan (BGMS described
                above), nor is it the same as a DST. It's a drive scan that
                will go check itself for issues and update attributes. Uncommon
                and not supported on most drives.

        --showSMARTErrorLog [ summary | comprehensive ] (SATA Only)
                This option will display the ATA SMART Error log on the screen.
                Use "summary" to view the summary SMART error log (last 5
                entries). Use "comprehensive" to view all the entires the drive
                has available. Specifying "comprehensive" will automatically
                pull the ext error log on drives that support 48bit LBAs.

                Note: The summary error log will truncate 48bit commands, so
                some information will be missing to describe the operation of
                certain commands.

        --smartErrorLogFormat [ raw | detailed ]        (SATA Only)
                Use this option to change the format of the output from the
                --showSMARTErrorLog option. The default mode is "detailed".

        SAS Only:
        =========
        --setMRIE [ default | 0 - 6 ]  (SAS Only) (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to change the MRIE mode on the informational
                exceptions mode page.
                    default - set to the drive default
                    0 - Disable exception reporting
                    1 - Asynchronous reporting (obsolete)
                    2 - Establish unit attention condition
                    3 - Conditionally generate recovered error
                    4 - Unconditionally generate recovered error
                    5 - Generate no sense
                    6 - Report on request

        --showSCSIDefects [ p | g | pg ]        (SAS Only)
                This option will display the SCSI defects on the screen. The
                arguments to this will tell whether to get the grown, primary,
                or primary and grown defects from the drive. Use the
                --defectFormat option to specify the mode to display the
                defects. If no mode is specified, physical cylinder-head-sector
                mode is assumed.

                Arguments:
                p - use this option to pull and display the primary (factory)
                    defects
                g - use this option to pull and display the grown (reallocated)
                    defects
                pg - the options can be combined to pull and display both
                    defect lists.

        --defectFormat [ # | shortBlock | longBlock | xbfi | xchs | bfi | chs ] (SAS Only)
                This option set the format of the defects to output. Not all
                drives will support all defect modes. SSDs will only support
                block modes.

                Arguments: show the defects in either name or # mode
                shortBlock | 0    short block address mode (drives < 32bit LBA)
                xbfi       | 1    extended bytes from index mode
                xchs       | 2    extended physical cylinder-head-sector mode
                longBlock  | 3    long block address mode (drives > 32bit LBA)
                bfi        | 4    bytes from index mode
                chs        | 5    physical cylinder-head-sector mode

                Examples: --defectFormat 3, or --defectFormat longBlock

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Sector Repair Commands
======================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        --confirm  I-understand-this-command-may-erase-single-sectors-if-they-are-already-unreadable ... etc

        --dstAndClean
                Runs DST, then checks for an error and repairs the error if
                possible. This continues until all errors reported by DST are
                fixed, or when the error limit is reached. The default limit is
                50 errors.  See --errorLimit to change limit.

        --seagateClean                  (Seagate Only)
                Checks logs for errors and repairs them if possible. After
                repairing all errors, each error is read around to check for
                other errors to repair. Finally, a DST & Clean operation is run
                to verify the drive is good and no more errors exist. Test will
                stop when the error limit is reached. The default limit is 50
                errors.  See --errorLimit to change limit.

See the section below "Bad LBA (Sector) Found" for more information on this
subject.

======================
Bad LBA (Sector) Found
======================
IMPORTANT: Please read and carefully consider all of the following information
about your "Bad LBA (Logical Block Address, or Sector) Found" options.

A bad sector is a small 512-byte area on the disk drive that is reporting
errors and cannot be accessed properly. New bad sectors, sometimes called grown
defects, are often caused by some kind of physical damage. If a file or folder
uses this sector, then the file is already incomplete or corrupt because the
bytes are not readable.

**** NOTE **** The following information applies only to Seagate Technology,
Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie brand disk drives:

When SeaChest discovers a bad LBA (sector) through reading, it displays a count
of the bad sectors.

Sectors are often not in use. If a sector is in use, then that file is
incomplete or corrupt. When a bad sector happens to align with a folder or
directory listing structure, then the links to files and sub-folders it manages
may be broken.

You should carefully consider the importance of your data. While the sector is
currently unreadable, if the file or folder is important to you then you may
need professional recovery services to possibly reclaim the data. In this case,
select to scan without trying to repair sectors on the drive.

If you have decided that the file or folder is replaceable, already backed up
or just not important to you, then you can tell SeaChest to attempt to attempt
to repair the sector.  See the Sector Repair Commands section above.

By design, modern disk drives maintain spare sectors for reallocation purposes.
Usually, sectors become difficult to read long before they become impossible to
read. In this situation the actual data bytes in the sector are preserved and
transferred to the new spare during a sector reallocation. Similarly, when a
disk drive writes data and encounters a problem, the drive firmware retires the
problem sector and activates a replacement before giving successful write
status.

If you give permission to attempt to repair a bad sector, then SeaChest will
attempt to write a 512-byte pattern of zeros to that single error sector.
Usually, this action will assist the disk drive firmware in managing the
problem by retiring the problem sector and activating a spare in its place. If
the attempted repair fails to reallocate the LBA to an available spare, then
the test is a FAIL and the drive is bad.

Note: Seagate Technology is not responsible for lost user data.

Sections below are common to all tools:

Utility arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add--usbChildInfo to
                display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest_Erase in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest_Erase version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --hideLBACounter
                Use this option to supress the output from options that show
                LBA counters without turning off all output to the screen.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --hours [hours]
                Use this option to specify a time in hours for a timed
                operation to run.

        --minutes [minutes]
                Use this option to specify a time in minutes for a timed
                operation to run.

        --seconds [seconds]
                Use this option to specify a time in seconds for a timed
                operation to run.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the SeaChest -s option to determine what /dev/sg? or PD? device
handle assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you
other details about the drive including the current firmware revision.

Linux:
Vendor     Handle       Model Number       Serial Number     FwRev
ATA        /dev/sg0     ST94813AS          3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    /dev/sg1     ST1000NM0011       ZAA15VAS          SN03

Windows:
Vendor     Handle   Model Number        Serial Number     FwRev
IDE        PD0      ST94813AS           3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    PD1      ST1000NM0011        ZAA15VAS          SN03

You can use SeaChest -s --onlySeagate to limit the display to just Seagate.

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the sg or PD device handle (-d, --device).

Lin example, SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg1 --shortDST --poll
Win example, SeaChest_Basics -d PD2 --shortDST --poll

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
in Linux, SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and
SMART.  In Windows, SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -i --smartCheck runs both
identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d /dev/sg# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example, in Linux,
SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -d /dev/sg3 -i runs identify on these two
devices.  In Windows, SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on
these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

If the task is an OFFLINE command like format unit or short DST, meaning that
the drive works on the task in the background and the tool quickly returns to
the command prompt (there is little or no I/O to the system), then you can
expect the system to run normally. If the task has high I/O to the system like
a sequential read of all sectors on the drive, then you can expect the system
to slow down with each additional device.

The discussion above is about starting SEQUENTIAL tests, or one after the
other.  When the task does not return to the command prompt for a very long
time, then you have a few options to run tests in PARALLEL, also called
simultaneous, in other words all at the same time.  One way is to start
different drives in different Terminal windows, if available.  There are other
more sophisticated methods using parallel processing, for information about
these methods please see the information at this link:
https://github.com/Seagate/ToolBin/tree/master/SeaChest/parallel_testing

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to -I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time or
-I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

Windows Only Usage
==================
All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then SeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

Windows Restrictions Over SATA Firmware Downloads
-------------------------------------------------
You should not attempt downloading firmware to a SATA disk drive in the Windows
operating system unless the drive supports the 'deferred' mode.  You define the
mode with the SeaChest command line option '--downloadMode deferred'.  If the
drive does not support deferred mode then the command will be aborted.  Windows
may not be so restrictive on secondary, non-boot SATA drives or SATA drives
attached to host bus adapters (HBAs, controllers, USB, etc).

If you force a primary SATA boot drive to download firmware in Windows using a
different --downloadMode setting, then the result will likely be a BSOD (blue
screen of death) system crash.  This is because the legacy SATA firmware
download modes require the drive to spin down and then back up and the
momentary disappearance of the drive causes the operating system to crash.
Windows is actually protecting the system when it thinks the drive has stopped
responding (see wikis about Ring 0 Protection).

The 'deferred' mode does not spin down the drive.  Instead, the drive waits for
a future reboot of the system and self-activates the firmware at that time.
Other operating systems may utilize the SeaChest --activateFW command to
trigger the switch to the new firmware version.

=========================
Linux General Usage Hints
=========================
Remember that Linux file names and command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Display a file listing with the Linux command: ls -lah

The tool will require root privileges to run using either sudo or su commands.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

A dot slash is a dot followed immediately by a forward slash (./). It is used
in Linux to execute a compiled program in the current directory when it is not
a built-in command or found in your path.

For example, ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll
or, sudo ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

Shut down the files system and remove the power with the command:
poweroff

See previous screen history with the key combination:
Shift+PgUp or Shift+PgDn

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.
For example,
SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck | tee -a mySeaChestLog.txt

Display a log or text file with the Linux "less" command: less myfile.log
Press the letter q to quit displaying the file.  Similarly, you can easily
read the Seagate License agreement by piping the output to the less
command with SeaChest --license |less

Display a list of sg (SCSI generic) devices with the command:
cat /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/model
or
ls /dev/sg*

sg devices include the following interfaces: SATA, USB, SCSI (SCSI, SAS and FC)

Add the command word 'time' on the same command line before the SeaChest
command to see how much time it takes to run a test.
For example, time ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

When drives are not detected by SeaChest
--------------------------------------------
The problem is that the sg driver isn't loaded on the system on boot.  You can
test if it is loaded by doing "ls /dev/sg*" and see if anything shows up. If
nothing shows up then the SG driver is missing (which is required by
SeaChest to issue commands).

You need to do "modprobe sg" as root to load the sg module (since it wasn't
compiled into the kernel), then you will get sg devices that we can scan and
find. Once you run the modprobe command and sg is successfully loaded, then you
can re-run "ls /dev/sg*" and see SG device nodes. SeaChest tools should
then be able to find devices once again.

How to control the amount of runtime kernel messages
----------------------------------------------------
When testing more drives than a system can hold, careful use of host adapters
and hot-plugging batches of drives (but never to direct motherboard
connections!) can help speed the process.  The Linux operating system will
display various system error messages, or none, when storage devices are
powered down and exchanged with the next drives.  The amount of information
contained in the OS error messages can be reviewed using the Linux utility
command "sysctl kernel.printk".  The default setting is defined by the
particular distro.  Tiny Core Linux, for example may set "4 4 1 7".  To hide
hot-plugging messages try "3 4 1 7", to increase the messaging to include
device details like model numbers try "6 4 1 7".  The command to set is 'sudo
sysctl -w kernel.printk="6 4 1 7"'.  See man sysctl - "configure kernel
parameters at runtime" for more.

Tesing storage devices on the USB and Thunderbolt interfaces
------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when testing a storage device, it is more convenient to attach it as
an external drive to the test system. In the case of SATA drives there are very
many SATA-to-USB 'bridge' adapters available.  The quality and range of command
'passthrough' support for these adapters varies greatly.  Our tools will
attempt to work through these adapters.

If your notebook has a Thunderbolt interface connection then you may be able to
test a wide range of devices.  External Thunderbolt expansion systems provide a
PCIe slot in a chassis that can hold a SAS, NVMe, or SATA host adapter. The
host adapters would have cables that go out to your test bench where you would
provide the drive and an external power supply for the drives. Thunderbolt 2
expansion systems work in Linux by default. Thunderbolt 3 expansion systems
need to be enabled in the kernel with boot time options before it will be
recognized by the Linux operating system. See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/thunderbolt.html for
information about how to activate the interface.

===========================
Windows General Usage Hints
===========================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Setup for Windows
-----------------
The SeaChest Utilities Setup places all of the files at "C:\Program
Files\Seagate\SeaChest" and adds an icon on the Desktop.  Clicking the icon
will open a Windows command prompt in Administrator mode at this location.
From there you will need to type the full command line for the tool and device
and options to run the test you require.  See the various SeaChest Help
documentation for descriptions and examples of the various commands.

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual SeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just
clicking on the file name. If started that way, the SeaChest utility will
briefly show a black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when
trying to run it from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the SeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

SATA SSD SMART Attributes example.

The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes. Some attributes
are industry standard and most others are vendor unique. Most attributes are
informational and not used to determine a warranty return. Use the --smartCheck
command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been tripped.

Reminder: Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 64-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerControl - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *

*                                                                      *
*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *
*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *
*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *
*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *
*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).
