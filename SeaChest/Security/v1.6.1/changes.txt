                     don't support LBA mode, bug fix where the last digit of
                     the SCSI Unit Serial Number was being dropped, additional
                     logic for deferred download completion status. --scan
                     --onlySeagate for just Seagate drives in a large system,
                     Long Drive Self Test Time in the -i output, write protect
                     status has been added for SCSI and NVMe in the -i output,
                     IDD enhancements for SAS, IDD enhancements to allow
                     captive mode on SATA, added USB Hacks to better support
                     some odd-ball USB devices and prevent crashes and improve
                     performance for some operations on them by issuing test
                     unit ready commands when something fails during device
                     discovery, automatic fall back to SAT 10 byte commands
                     during device discovery to help work with some USB
                     devices, some Legacy SCSI support enhancements (partially
                     from USB hacks development), enhanced SD to SG mapping in
                     Linux.
