Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Security diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Security is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
configure, change or set various properties on Seagate disk drives (this
includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie).  Some commands may cause existing
data on the drive to become inaccessible.  Some commands may affect the
performance of the drive.

References are made to TCG (Trusted Computing Group), a standards organization
formed to promote open standards for hardware-enabled security technologies.
You can read about TCG at http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/ and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing_Group.

NOTE: SeaChest_Security may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Security.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Be very careful using SeaChest_Security. Power failure during a configuration
change may cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Important note: Many tests in this tool directly reference storage device data
sectors, also known as Logical Block Addresses (LBA). Test arguments may
require a starting LBA or an LBA range.  The predefined variable 'maxLBA'
refers to the last sector on the drive.  Many older SATA and SAS storage
controllers (also known as Host Bus Adapters [HBA]) have a maximum addressable
limit of 4294967295 [FFFFh] LBAs hard wired into their design.  This equates to
2.1TB using 512 byte sectors.  This also means accessing an LBA beyond the
2.1TB limitation either will result in an error or simply the last readable LBA
(usually LBA 4294967295 [FFFFh]) depending on the actual hardware.  This
limitation can have important consequences.  For example, if you intended to
erase a 4TB drive, then only the first 2TB will actually get erased (or maybe
even twice!) and the last 2TB will remain untouched.  You should carefully
evaluate your system hardware to understand if your storage controllers provide
support for greater than 2.1TB.

Usage - Linux
=============
        SeaChest_Security [-d <sg_device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Linux
================
        SeaChest_Security --scan
        SeaChest_Security -d /dev/sg2 -i
        SeaChest_Security --device /dev/sg1 --tcgInfo

Usage - Windows
===============
        SeaChest_Security [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples - Windows
==================
        SeaChest_Security --scan
        SeaChest_Security -d PD2 -i
        SeaChest_Security --device PD1 --tcgInfo

Utility Arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                    Linux:
                     sd             - show /dev/sd? device handles
                     sgtosd         - show the sd and sg device handle mapping
                    Windows:
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the sg device handle (target drive) on which to perform an
                operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for
                information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example Lin: -d /dev/sg5
                Example Win: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add --usbChildInfo
                to display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --displayLBA [LBA | maxLBA]
                This option will read and display the contents of the specified
                LBA to the screen. The display format is hexadecimal with an
                ASCII translation on the side (when available).  The predefined
                text string "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to
                indicate the last sector on the drive instead of the specific
                LBA number.

        --tcgInfo
                This option shows information about a TCG device. Displays
                drive 'Use State'.

        --fwdlPort [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the logical firmware download port on a
                TCG drive to the requested state. Use the --sid option to
                provide SID for this operation. If SID is not provided, MSID
                will be used.
                    lock - lock the port and prevent its use
                    unlock - unlock the port to allow its use

        --udsPort [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the logical UDS port on a TCG drive to the
                requested state. Use the --sid option to provide SID for this
                operation. If SID is not provided, MSID will be used.
                    lock - lock the port and prevent its use
                    unlock - unlock the port to allow its use

        --ieee1667Port [lock | unlock] (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the logical IEEE 1667 port on a TCG drive
                to the requested state. Use the --sid option to provide SID for
                this operation. If SID is not provided, MSID will be used.
                    lock - lock the port and prevent its use
                    unlock - unlock the port to allow its use

                Note: This command may not run under Windows 10 and above unless
                      the drive supports various preconditions in firmware.
                      Linux should work without preconditions.

        --psid [32-digit alpha numeric code from drive label]
                This option can be used to specify the value of the PSID.
                This may be required in order to perform certain TCG
                operations.

                The PSID (Physical Security IDentification number) is a
                32-digit number & capital letter sequence printed on the label.
                There is no electronic query for this number, therefore the
                drive must be removed in order to read the PSID number.  Many
                drives have a PSID code on the label but are NOT marked as
                "Seagate Secure"; these drives do not support revertSP
                cryptographic erase.

                Enter the PSID without spaces. FIVE attempts are allowed before
                a power cycle is required. It can also be read by 2D barcode
                reader. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults.

                Example: --revertSP --psid 123ALL32DIGITS123ALL32DIGITS123A

        --sid [yourTCGpassword]
                This option can be used to specify the value of SID. This may
                be required in order to perform certain TCG operations. If this
                is not provided, MSID will be used.  As a practical matter, if
                you have implemented TCG boot authentication software tools,
                then the actual password may be completely different from the
                drive's point of view.  In other words, software and BIOS tools
                commonly run hash algorithms or use keyboard scan codes as
                added security instead of plain ASCII characters when saving
                drive passwords.

                You may need to cryptographically erase all data on the drive
                with --revertSP to clear the existing SID before the
                lock|unlock options can be set before installing the operating
                system and user data.  You should consult you TCG software
                vendor for instruction and advice about disabling or removing
                the SID before erasing your data.

                If the SID or MSID are not set (such as a new drive) then the
                various lock|unlock commands won't need the --sid option.

                Example: --revert --sid yourTCGpassword

        --disableDataLocking (Seagate Only)
                Use this option to disable data locking on a TCG drive.
                This option is only available when the drive has not had
                SID changed (taken ownership). This prevents locking the
                drive when it isn't being used with security software.
                Once this operation is completed, you will not be able to
                authenticate to SID as MSID. This can be undone with a revertSP
                Note: Not all Enterprise TCG drives support this feature or
                they may need a firmware update to enable this capability

        --showLockedRegions
                Use this option to show the locked ranges or bands on TCG Opal
                or TCG Enterprise SED drives.

SATA Only
---------
        --ataSATsecurityProtocol [enable | disable]         (SATA only)
                This option can be used to force enable or disable using the
                ATA security protocol as specified in the SAT specification. By
                default, the tool will use this method when it is supported to
                allow the SATL to understand and manage the security commands
                being performed and prevent other issues.

                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If a drive
                lost power during an ATA Security Erase in SeaChest, then using
                the password SeaChest with type 'user' will remove the temporary
                password set by the utility.

                Example:
                --ataSATsecurityProtocol disable --ataSecPassword SeaChest --ataSecPassType user

                Some commands like --scan and --deviceInfo will still run on a
                locked drive. To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS
                must have set the password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash
                the password typed in the configuration however it chooses and
                this utility has no idea how to match what the BIOS has done so
                it may not always work to remove a password set by something
                other than this utility. See the --ataSecPWMod command below
                for additional alternatives.

        --ataSecPassword ["ASCII password" | SeaChest | empty]      (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify a password to use with an ATA
                security operation. If specifying a password with spaces,
                quotes must be used. If SeaChest is given, the default SeaChest
                password will be used. If empty is given, an empty password
                will be used.

                Examples:
                  "This is a valid password"
                  ThisIsAlsoValid
                  "This password uses \"quotes\"
                  "This password is \/\/eird"

                Note: Windows PE offers an ATA Security Erase feature. If the
                erase is interrupted then a temporary password
                AutoATAWindowsString12345678901 is still set.

                Note: See the section below "When drives are reported Security
                "Frozen" by SeaChest".

        --ataSecPassType [user | master]                (SATA only)
                Use this option to specify if the password being given with the
                --ataSecPassword option is a user or a master password. If this
                option is not provided, user is assumed.

        --ataSecPWMod [byteswapped | zeropad | spacepad | fpad | leftAlign |
          rightAlign | uppercase | lowercase | invertcase] (SATA Only)
                Use this option to have the utility make modifications to the
                ATA security password to attempt other various ways it may be
                sent by a system bios. These are not guaranteed to work, but
                may help unlock a drive that was locked by a BIOS that encoded
                the password in a unique way. This option can be presented
                multiple times to select multiple modifications.

                EX: --ataSecPWMod byteswapped --ataSecPWMod invertcase
                  byteswapped - byteswaps the password. EX: blah -> lbha
                  zeropad - zero pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  spacepad - space pads the password if less than 32 characters
                  fpad - pads the passwords with Fh (all 1's) if less than
                     32characters
                  leftAlign - left aligns the password in the buffer
                  rightAlign - right aligns the password in the buffer
                  uppercase - sends the password as all uppercase
                  lowercase - sends the password as all lowercase
                  invertcase - switches uppercase for lower, and lowercase for
                  upper

        --ataSecFreeze          (SATA only)
                This option will send the ATA security freezelock command to a
                device. This command prevents all other ATA security commands
                from being processed until the next reset or power cycle.

        --ataSecurityInfo               (SATA only)
                This option shows information about the ATA security feature on
                ATA devices. It will show the security state and flags related
                to the state, Master password capability & ID, time to perform
                a secure erase, whether user data is encrypted, and whether
                sanitize can override ATA security to repurpose a drive.

        --disableATASecPW               (SATA Only)
                Use this option to disable an ATA security password. If the
                drive is in high security mode, either user or master password
                may be provided. In maximum security mode only the user
                password can be provided to unlock and disable the ATA security
                password. The master may only be used to erase the drive in
                maximum security mode. Use the --ataSecPassword option to
                provide the password to use and --ataSecPassType to specify
                whether it is the user or master password.

                If a drive lost power during an ATA Security Erase in
                SeaChest_Security, then providing --ataSecPassword SeaChest
                will use the default SeaChest password used during the erase.
                To disable a password set by a BIOS, the BIOS must have set the
                password in ASCII. A BIOS may choose to hash or modify the
                password typed in the configuration however it chooses and this
                utility has no idea how to match what the BIOS has done so it
                may not always work to remove a password set by something other
                than this utility.

        --unlockATASec          (SATA only)
                Use this option along with the --ataSecPassword option and
                --ataSecPassType option to unlock a drive with the provided
                password.  If the drive is in maximum security mode, only the
                user password may be used to unlock the device.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        Windows only:
        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        --confirm this-command-will-erase-data ... etc

        --revert
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification Revert on a Self Encrypting
                Drive (SED). This operation is only available on Seagate TCG
                Opal drives. Seagate SED drives are marked on the label with
                the words "Seagate Secure".  No all Seagate SED drives are TCG
                Opal compliant.

                In order to complete this operation, the lockingSP must not be
                activated, as this option will activate it in order to perform
                the revert. The value of SID, must also be the value of MSID as
                this operation must authenticate as SID using the value of
                MSID. Upon completion, the drive will be "like new" with all
                user data being cryptographically erased and all other settings
                set to factory defaults. If this operation fails, use
                --revertSP instead.

                Example: --revert --sid yourTCGpassword

        --revertSP
                This command is very fast at less than one (1) second. It
                changes the internal encryption keys that are used for user
                data causing all previous data to be useless. This operation
                performs an Opal SSC specification revertSP on a Self
                Encrypting Drive (SED). This operation is available on all
                Seagate SED drives which are marked on the label with the words
                "Seagate Secure". Requires the --psid code from the label.

                Example: --revertSP --psid 123ALL32DIGITS123ALL32DIGITS123A
                Note: If a Secure product does not recognize the --revertSP
                --psid combination, try --revert --psid as the two commands are
                closely related.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the SeaChest -s option to determine what /dev/sg? or PD? device
handle assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you
other details about the drive including the current firmware revision.

Linux:
Vendor     Handle       Model Number       Serial Number     FwRev
ATA        /dev/sg0     ST94813AS          3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    /dev/sg1     ST1000NM0011       ZAA15VAS          SN03

Windows:
Vendor     Handle   Model Number        Serial Number     FwRev
IDE        PD0      ST94813AS           3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    PD1      ST1000NM0011        ZAA15VAS          SN03

You can use SeaChest -s --onlySeagate to limit the display to just Seagate.

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the sg or PD device handle (-d, --device).

Lin example, SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg1 --shortDST --poll
Win example, SeaChest_Basics -d PD2 --shortDST --poll

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
in Linux, SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and
SMART.  In Windows, SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -i --smartCheck runs both
identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d /dev/sg# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example, in Linux,
SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -d /dev/sg3 -i runs identify on these two
devices.  In Windows, SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on
these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to -I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time or
-I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

Windows Only Usage
==================
All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then SeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

When drives are reported Security "Frozen" by SeaChest
------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Your system or the SeaChest software may report that a SATA password
cannot be changed because it is "frozen". Many systems BIOS will automatically
set the ATA SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command on all SATA drives at start up. The
SECURITY FREEZE LOCK command prevents changes to all Security states until a
following power-on reset or hardware reset. The purpose of the SECURITY FREEZE
LOCK command is to prevent password setting attacks on the security system.

The SeaChest --deviceInfo command will display something similar to this: "ATA
Security Information: Supported, Frozen". To disable Freeze Lock, first check
your BIOS SATA disk options to control the setting at start up. Otherwise, you
might pause the boot up shortly after powering on the system and then
temporarily remove the power to the security frozen drive (let it completely
spin down). When the power is back on the drive it will start without being
frozen.

Windows systems may also decide not to recognize the drive if it is ATA
Security Locked and it will not be listed by the SeaChest --scan command.  If
the drive remains undetected in Windows, your alternative is to make a bootable
USB flash drive and run SeaChest_Erase from the Linux operating system.

==============================
Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
==============================
Abstract
--------
The SeaChest_Erase --revert and --revertSP commands require specific support be
enabled in the Linux kernel.  This document describes the process to enable
support for sending ATA Trusted Trusted Computing Group (TCG) commands in
Linux. The focus is on how to do this through Ubuntu Linux 14.04LTS, however,
the process should apply to other Linux’s as well although others may vary
slightly.

Modifying The GRUB Configuration File (Ubuntu example used)
-----------------------------------------------------------
In order to make the change to allow TCG commands persist across reboots, you
must modify the kernel boot parameters. In Ubuntu, this is accomplished by
modifying the GRUB 2 configuration file. This section references the Grub2
configuration documentation from the Ubuntu Community:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup#Configuring_GRUB_2

Follow these steps to perform this modification in Ubuntu (other Linux’s may be
similar).

1. You must modify the file /etc/default/grub. You can do this by running "sudo
gedit /etc/default/grub"

2. Once this file is open in the editor of your choice, add
"libata.allow_tpm=1" to the line  that begins with "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT"
(or which ever line in grub is the one you use to boot your kernel, but this is
the default).

3. Close your editor

4. Run the command "sudo update-grub" to apply your changes to the grub boot
configuration (the file modified in these steps is a config file for the config
file).

5. Restart your computer to make this active

Temporarily Enabling TCG Commands In Linux
------------------------------------------
You can temporarily enable TCG commands without modifying the kernel boot
parameters. This can be accomplished by modifying the libata parameters file.
Below is a sample script that can be run to do this.

Sample Script:

cd /sys/module/libata/parameters
sudo chmod 644 allow_tpm
echo 1 | sudo dd of=./allow_tpm
sudo chmod 444 allow_tpm

Tiny Core - Enabling TCG Commands
------------------------------------------
Follow these steps to enable TCG commands on a Tiny Core bootable USB flash
drive.

1. Leave the USB flash drive in after you run the Windows-based USB boot maker
tool.

2. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/boot/syslinux.cfg and in there, add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the append line with the other kernel boot parameters.

3. Using a (Windows) text editor go to USB:/EFI/boot/refind.conf and add
libata.allow_tpm=1 on the options line with the other kernel boot parameters

Alternate method:
If Linux is already booted and you only want to temporarily enable TCG
commands, you can change the contents of
/sys/module/libata/parameters/allow_tpm from "0" to a "1".

=========================
Linux General Usage Hints
=========================
Remember that Linux file names and command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Display a file listing with the Linux command: ls -lah

The tool will require root privileges to run using either sudo or su commands.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

A dot slash is a dot followed immediately by a forward slash (./). It is used
in Linux to execute a compiled program in the current directory when it is not
a built-in command or found in your path.

For example, ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll
or, sudo ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

Shut down the files system and remove the power with the command:
poweroff

See previous screen history with the key combination:
Shift+PgUp or Shift+PgDn

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.
For example,
SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck | tee -a mySeaChestLog.txt

Display a log or text file with the Linux "less" command: less myfile.log
Press the letter q to quit displaying the file.  Similarly, you can easily
read the Seagate License agreement by piping the output to the less
command with SeaChest --license |less

Display a list of sg (SCSI generic) devices with the command:
cat /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/model
or
ls /dev/sg*

sg devices include the following interfaces: SATA, USB, SCSI (SCSI, SAS and FC)

Add the command word 'time' on the same command line before the SeaChest
command to see how much time it takes to run a test.
For example, time ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

When drives are not detected by SeaChest
--------------------------------------------
The problem is that the sg driver isn't loaded on the system on boot.  You can
test if it is loaded by doing "ls /dev/sg*" and see if anything shows up. If
nothing shows up then the SG driver is missing (which is required by
SeaChest to issue commands).

You need to do "modprobe sg" as root to load the sg module (since it wasn't
compiled into the kernel), then you will get sg devices that we can scan and
find. Once you run the modprobe command and sg is successfully loaded, then you
can re-run "ls /dev/sg*" and see SG device nodes. SeaChest tools should
then be able to find devices once again.

How to control the amount of runtime kernel messages
----------------------------------------------------
When testing more drives than a system can hold, careful use of host adapters
and hot-plugging batches of drives (but never to direct motherboard
connections!) can help speed the process.  The Linux operating system will
display various system error messages, or none, when storage devices are
powered down and exchanged with the next drives.  The amount of information
contained in the OS error messages can be reviewed using the Linux utility
command "sysctl kernel.printk".  The default setting is defined by the
particular distro.  Tiny Core Linux, for example may set "4 4 1 7".  To hide
hot-plugging messages try "3 4 1 7", to increase the messaging to include
device details like model numbers try "6 4 1 7".  The command to set is 'sudo
sysctl -w kernel.printk="6 4 1 7"'.  See man sysctl - "configure kernel
parameters at runtime" for more.

Tesing storage devices on the USB and Thunderbolt interfaces
------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when testing a storage device, it is more convenient to attach it as
an external drive to the test system. In the case of SATA drives there are very
many SATA-to-USB 'bridge' adapters available.  The quality and range of command
'passthrough' support for these adapters varies greatly.  Our tools will
attempt to work through these adapters.

If your notebook has a Thunderbolt interface connection then you may be able to
test a wide range of devices.  External Thunderbolt expansion systems provide a
PCIe slot in a chassis that can hold a SAS, NVMe, or SATA host adapter. The
host adapters would have cables that go out to your test bench where you would
provide the drive and an external power supply for the drives. Thunderbolt 2
expansion systems work in Linux by default. Thunderbolt 3 expansion systems
need to be enabled in the kernel with boot time options before it will be
recognized by the Linux operating system. See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/thunderbolt.html for
information about how to activate the interface.

===========================
Windows General Usage Hints
===========================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual SeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just
clicking on the file name. If started that way, the SeaChest utility will
briefly show a black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when
trying to run it from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the SeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 64-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerControl - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

    License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that
    controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For
    purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct
    or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
    whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than
    fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial
    ownership of such entity.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
