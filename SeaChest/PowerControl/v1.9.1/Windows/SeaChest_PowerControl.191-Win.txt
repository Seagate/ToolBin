Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_PowerControl diagnostic software.

Optimization within the framework of a complex company data center requires
dynamic technology. As storage capacity demands increase due to virtualization
and growing volumes of data, managing power usage in an intelligent way is
critical for reducing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

There are, roughly, three general frameworks for disk drive power management.
The earlier specification is part of Advanced Power Management (APM) which
provided controls over many devices in a system, including disk drives.  APM
has since been replaced by a new framework called Extended Power Controls
(EPC).  Seagate's implementation of EPC began to phase in starting in 2010 and
is named by the marketing term "PowerChoice".  Seagate PowerChoice
technology—specifically developed for enterprise environments—offers more
energy efficiency and control over the amount of power hard drives consume.

You may need to learn what capabilities for power management your drive offers,
such as supporting APM or EPC, and maybe both.  See the commands
--showEPCSettings or --showAPMLevel(SATA Only) or --deviceInfo for various
reports containing power settings and features supported.  Most enterprise
drives after 2016 only support EPC (PowerChoice).

PowerChoice technology improves on earlier technology and allows for
energy-saving during periods of command inactivity, allowing for greater power
reductions. As idle time increases, the power-saving benefits also increase,
and the drives will still quickly respond to commands even after long idling
periods. In addition, PowerChoice technology supports four customizable modes
to give businesses significantly more control of power usage by allowing for up
to a 54% reduction in the amount of energy used.

See the section below "How PowerChoice Technology Works"

The third and newest drive power management framework exists for SATA drives
and is named PowerBalance.  Seagate's PowerBalance feature will adjust drive
performance during random operations to reduce power consumption of the drive.

SeaChest is a comprehensive, easy-to-use command line diagnostic tool that
helps you quickly determine the status of your Seagate storage product.

Tests and commands which are completely data safe will run on any disk drive.
Tests and commands which change the drive (like firmware download or data
erasure or setting the maximum capacity, etc) are limited to Seagate disk
drives (this includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie). Be careful using
SeaChest because some of the features, like the data erasure options, will
cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Usage
=====
        SeaChest_PowerControl [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples
========
        SeaChest_PowerControl --scan
        SeaChest_PowerControl -d PD0 -i
        SeaChest_PowerControl -d PD1 --deviceInfo

Utility arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -S, --Scan   (note the capital letter S)
                This option is the same as --scan or -s, however it will also
                perform a low level rescan to pick up other devices. This
                low-level rescan may wake devices from low power states and may
                cause the OS to re-enumerate them. Use this diagnostic option
                when a device is plugged in and not discovered in a normal scan.

                NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces
                or all OSs.  The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find
                additional devices in the system when the device is unable to
                come to a ready state.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the PD physical device handle (target drive) on which to
                perform an operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints'
                for information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example: -d PD0, or -d PD3

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge. To see the child drive
                details add --usbChildInfo to the command line options.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --checkPowerMode
                Get the current power mode of a drive. On SCSI devices, this
                will only work if the drive has transitioned from active state
                to another state.  In Windows, the --checkPowerMode command
                will always wake up SATA drives which are controlled by the
                default Microsoft drivers.  This means you cannot check the
                power mode and determine that it is in Idle or Standby. Drives
                on secondary controllers or non-Microsoft device drivers may
                accept the --checkPowerMode command without waking up the drive.

        --spinDown
                Removes power to the disk drive motor with the Standby
                Immediate for SATA, or standby_z for SAS. Use this before
                moving a hard disk drive. The drive will spin back up if the
                operating system selects the drive. This means that an active
                drive will not stay spun down.

                In the case of SSD devices, the drive will flush the temporary
                caches and prepare for shutdown.

        --idle
                This command will transition a drive to the idle power state.
                This command may flush the cache before the transition to this
                state.  This command is for non-EPC enabled drives. If the
                drive has the EPC feature enabled, it is recommended that the
                --transitionPower option be used instead. This option is
                compatible with EPC enabled drives as well, but offers less
                control over the transition. If the operating system selects
                this drive, it will transition it back to an active state.

        --idleUnload
                This command will transition a drive to the idle, heads
                unloaded, power state. This command may flush the cache before
                the transition to this state.  This command is for non-EPC
                enabled drives.  If the drive has the EPC feature enabled, it
                is recommended that the --transitionPower option be used
                instead. This option is compatible with EPC enabled drives as
                well, but offers less control over the transition. If the
                operating system selects this drive, it will transition it back
                to an active state.

        --standby
                This command will transition a drive to the standby power
                state.  This command will flush the cache before the transition
                to this state.  This command is for non-EPC enabled drives. If
                the drive has the EPC feature enabled, it is recommended that
                the --transitionPower option be used instead. This option is
                compatible with EPC enabled drives as well, but offers less
                control over the transition.  On an HDD, this will cause the
                spindle motor to stop.  If the operating system selects this
                drive, it will transition it back to an active state.

        --active
                This command will transition a drive to the active power state.
                This uses a ATA read-verify command to a random LBA, or a SCSI
                start-stop unit command.

        --showEPCSettings
                Use this option to show the current Extended Power Conditions
                (EPC) settings on the screen. Only drives supporting the EPC
                feature will show this data and only supported power conditions
                will be shown.

        --EPCfeature [enable | disable]
                Enables or disables Extended Power Conditions (EPC) support for
                devices.  To disable EPC use --EPCfeature disable. Note that the
                EPC Feature Set is not supported on all devices. Use
                --deviceInfo option to see if EPC is supported.

        --changePower
                Use this option to enable or disable certain --powerMode and
                their timers. You can also use this option to restore default
                values to the drive. The available power modes are idle_a,
                idle_b, idle_c, standby_y (SAS only), standby_z, or all. "all"
                can only be used to enable/disable/default everything. It
                cannot be used to set a timer. Timer values are specified in
                milliseconds.

                Example restore: --changePower --defaultMode --powerMode idle_a
                Example enable: --changePower --enableMode --powerMode idle_a
                Example set timer: --changePower --enableMode --powerMode idle_a
                                   --modeTimer 5000

        --enableMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to enable
                a specific --powerMode.

        --modeTimer [timer value in milliseconds]
                Use this option to specify a timer value to use with the
                --changePower mode option.

        --disableMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to disable
                a specific --powerMode.

        --defaultMode
                Use this option with the --changePower mode option to restore
                the default settings for a specific --powerMode.  The "all"
                option is only valid for SAS interface drives.

        --transitionPower
                Use this option to actively change --powerMode. The available
                power modes are idle_a, idle_b, idle_c, standby_y (SAS only),
                standby_z, or active (SAS only).

                Note: Hard disk drives require a few seconds time to spin up or
                down. The drive will report the old power mode until it is
                fully established in the new mode.  The SeaChest --spinDown
                command is similar.  On SAS --spinDown is equivalent to Motor
                Stop and --transitionPower --powerMode active is equivalent to
                Motor Start.

                Example: --transitionPower --powerMode idle_a
                Example: --transitionPower --powerMode standby_y

        --powerMode [powermode]
                Use this option to specify a power mode. This should be used
                with the --changePower or --transitionPower options.
                Valid power modes (SAS and SATA):
                        idle_a
                        idle_b
                        idle_c
                        standby_y (SAS only)
                        standby_z
                        active (SAS only, used with --trasitionPower)
                        all (used with --changePower enable, disable or default)
                Valid power modes (NVMe): 0 - 30

        --showPowerConsumption  (SAS Only)
                This option will show the power consumption rates supported by
                the device and the current power consumption rate of the
                device. Use a supported watt value with the
                --setPowerConsumption option to set the power consumption to
                that value.

        --setPowerConsumption [default | highest | intermediate | lowest |
          watt value]   (SAS Only) (Seagate Only)
                This option will set the power consumption rate of the device
                to the value input.
                Options:
                        default - sets the device back to default settings
                        highest - sets the active level to "highest"
                        intermediate - sets the active level to "intermediate"
                        lowest - sets the active level to "lowest"
                        watt value - sets the device to a nearest watt value
                           less than or equal to the value entered.

                Power consumption watt values are listed with the
                --showPowerConsumption command line option.

        --showAPMLevel   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to show the current Advanced Power Management
                (APM) level of a device

        --setAPMLevel [1 - 254]   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to set the APM level of a device. Valid values
                are between 1 and 254.  This setting is non-volatile so it
                holds across power cycles.
                      1 = Minimum power consumption with standby mode
                  2-127 = Intermediate power management with standby mode
                    128 = Minimum power consumption without standby mode
                129-253 = Intermediate power management without standby mode
                    254 = Maximum Performance

        --disableAPM   (SATA Only)
                Use this option to disable the current Advanced Power Management (APM) level of a device

        --powerBalanceFeature [ info | enable | disable ]   (SATA Only)(Seagate Only)
                Use this option to see the state of the Seagate PowerBalance
                feature or to change its state. Seagate's PowerBalance feature
                will adjust drive performance during random operations to
                reduce power consumption of the drive.
                    info - will display the state of the PowerBalance feature
                           on the screen
                    enable - use this to enable PowerBalance
                    disable - use this to disable PowerBalance
                Note: SAS products should use the --setPowerConsumption option
                instead.

        --sataDAPSfeature [info | enable | disable ]    (SATA Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the SATA Device Automatic
                Partial To Slumber Transitions (DAPS) feature. Use the "info"
                option to see the current state of the DIPM feature on the
                device. The use of this feature requires that the DIPM feature
                is enabled.

                NOTE: Please ensure that the host adapter/controller/driver can
                handle this before enabling it, otherwise the drive link may go
                down and the device will not be able to communicate.

        --sataDIPMfeature [info | enable | disable ]    (SATA Only)
                Use this option to enable or disable the SATA Device Initiated
                Power Management (DIPM) feature. Use the "info" option to see
                the current state of the DIPM feature on the device.

                NOTE: Please ensure that the host adapter/controller/driver can
                handle this before enabling it, otherwise the drive link may go
                down and the device will not be able to communicate.

Utility Options

                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided. May also be used with the --scan command.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001.
                The option --childModelMatch may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.
                The option --childOnlyFW may be used to match drives in USB
                enclosures.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the SeaChest_PowerControl -s option to determine what physical device
assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you other
details about the drive including the current firmware revision. Like this:

Vendor     Handle   Model Number        Serial Number     FwRev
IDE        PD0      ST94813AS           3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    PD1      ST1000NM0011        ZAA15VAS          SN03

You can use SeaChest -s --onlySeagate to limit the display to just Seagate.

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the physical device handle (-d, --device).

For example, SeaChest -d PD2 --spinDown

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
SeaChest_PowerControl -d PD1 -i --spinDown runs both identify and spin down.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d PD# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example,
SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then SeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

================================
How PowerChoice Technology Works
================================
See the Seagate technology paper "Seagate® PowerChoice™ Technology Provides
Unprecedented Hard Drive Power Savings and Flexibility"
http://www.seagate.com/files/docs/pdf/en-GB/whitepaper/tp608-powerchoice-tech-provides-gb.pdf

Each individual power condition builds on the capabilities of the previous
higher power condition in order to save incrementally more power. The specific
energy-saving steps implemented for each power condition are as follows:

Idle_A
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Discs rotating at full speed (7,200 RPM)
Idle_B
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Discs rotating at full speed (7,200 RPM)
Idle_C/Standby_Y (SAS Only)
        - Disables most of the servo system, reduces processor and channel
        power consumption
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Drive speed reduced to a lower RPM (reduced RPM)
Standby_Z
        - Heads are unloaded to drive ramp.
        - Drive motor is spun down.
        - Drive still responds to non-media access host commands.

Flexibility is a key feature of PowerChoice technology, enabling commands from
the host side to customize power condition settings and direct a drive into or
out of power conditions as required. Two different options are available for
the user to modify PowerChoice technology settings, depending on the interface
used:

SAS
        Host-definable timers via mode pages
        Immediate host-commanded power transitions via Start/Stop Unit (SSU)
        command
SATA
        Host-definable timers via Set Features commands
        Immediate host-commanded power transitions via Set Features commands

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\SeaChest_PowerControl --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Setup for Windows
-----------------
The SeaChest Utilities Setup places all of the files at "C:\Program
Files\Seagate\SeaChest" and adds an icon on the Desktop.  Clicking the icon
will open a Windows command prompt in Administrator mode at this location.
From there you will need to type the full command line for the tool and device
and options to run the test you require.  See the various SeaChest Help
documentation for descriptions and examples of the various commands.

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual SeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just clicking
on the file name. If started that way, the SeaChest utility will briefly show a
black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when trying to run it
from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the SeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerChoice - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

=================================

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its

    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
