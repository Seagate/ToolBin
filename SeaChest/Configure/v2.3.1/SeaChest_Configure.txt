===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_Configure diagnostic software.

SeaChest_Configure is a comprehensive command line tool that can be used to
configure, change or set various properties on Seagate disk drives (this
includes Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie).  Some commands may cause existing
data on the drive to become inaccessible.  Some commands may affect the
performance of the drive.

NOTE: SeaChest_Configure may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

This User Guide file contains important information about SeaChest_Configure.
Please read this entire file before using this software.

If this is your drive, you should always keep a current backup of your
important data.

Be very careful using SeaChest_Configure. Power failure during a configuration
change may cause data loss. Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

Important note: Many tests in this tool directly reference storage device data
sectors, also known as Logical Block Addresses (LBA). Test arguments may
require a starting LBA or an LBA range.  The predefined variable 'maxLBA'
refers to the last sector on the drive.  Many older SATA and SAS storage
controllers (also known as Host Bus Adapters [HBA]) have a maximum addressable
limit of 4294967295 [FFFFh] LBAs hard wired into their design.  This equates to
2.1TB using 512 byte sectors.  This also means accessing an LBA beyond the
2.1TB limitation either will result in an error or simply the last readable LBA
(usually LBA 4294967295 [FFFFh]) depending on the actual hardware.  This
limitation can have important consequences.  For example, if you intended to
erase a 4TB drive, then only the first 2TB will actually get erased (or maybe
even twice!) and the last 2TB will remain untouched.  You should carefully
evaluate your system hardware to understand if your storage controllers provide
support for greater than 2.1TB.

Note: One gigabyte, or GB, equals one billion bytes when referring to hard
drive capacity. This software may use information provided by the operating
system to display capacity and volume size. The Windows file system uses a
binary calculation for gibibyte or GiB (2^30) which causes the abbreviated size
to appear smaller. The total number of bytes on a disk drive divided by the
decimal calculation for gigabyte or GB (10^9) shows the expected abbreviated
size. See this FAQ for more information

Utility Arguments
=================
	-d, --device [deviceHandle | all]
		Use this option with most commands to specify the device
		handle on which to perform an operation. Example: /dev/sg<#>
		To run across all devices detected in the system, use the
		"all" argument instead of a device handle.
		Example: -d all
		NOTE: The "all" argument is handled by running the
		      specified options on each drive detected in the
		      OS sequentially. For parallel operations, please
		      use a script opening a separate instance for each
		      device handle.

	-F, --scanFlags [option list]
		Use this option to control the output from scan with the
		options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
			ata - show only ATA (SATA) devices
			usb - show only USB devices
			scsi - show only SCSI (SAS) devices
			nvme - show only NVMe devices
			interfaceATA - show devices on an ATA interface
			interfaceUSB - show devices on a USB interface
			interfaceSCSI - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
			interfaceNVME = show devices on an NVMe interface

		/dev/sg<#> assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware
		numbers.  If your device is not listed on a scan  immediately
		after booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

	-S, --Scan
		This option is the same as --scan or -s,
		however it will also perform a low level rescan to pick up
		other devices. This low level rescan may wake devices from low
		power states and may cause the OS to re-enumerate them.
		Use this option when a device is plugged in and not discovered in
		a normal scan.
		NOTE: A low-level rescan may not be available on all interfaces or
		all OSs. The low-level rescan is not guaranteed to find additional
		devices in the system when the device is unable to come to a ready state.

	--SATInfo
		Displays SATA device information on any interface
		using both SCSI Inquiry / VPD / Log reported data
		(translated according to SAT) and the ATA Identify / Log
		reported data.

	--testUnitReady
		Issues a SCSI Test Unit Ready command and displays the
		status. If the drive is not ready, the sense key, asc,
		ascq, and fru will be displayed and a human readable
		translation from the SPC spec will be displayed if one
		is available.

	--fastDiscovery
		Use this option  to issue a fast scan on the specified drive. 

	--phySpeed [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5]
		Use this option to change the PHY speed to a
		new maximum value. On SAS, this option will
		set all phys to the specified speed unless the
		--sasPhy option is given to select a specific phy.
		0 - allow full negotiation (default drive behavior)
		1 - allow negotiation up to 1.5Gb/s
		2 - allow negotiation up to 3.0Gb/s
		3 - allow negotiation up to 6.0Gb/s
		4 - allow negotiation up to 12.0Gb/s (SAS Only)
		5 - allow negotiation up to 22.5Gb/s (SAS Only)

		NOTE: SATA phy speed changes are only available on Seagate drives.

		WARNING: Check the minimum phy speed supported by your adapter before
		         using this option. A phy speed below the adapter's capability
		         will result in the drive not being seen by the adapter or the OS.

		WARNING: Changing Phy speed may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
		         with multiple logical units or namespaces.

	--readLookAhead [info | enable | disable]
		Use this option to enable or disable read look-ahead
		support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
		the current status of the read look ahead feature.

		WARNING: Changing Read look-ahead may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
		         with multiple logical units or namespaces.

	--restoreMaxLBA
		Restore the max accessible address of your drive to its native
		size. A power cycle is required after this command before
		setting a new max LBA.

	--setMaxLBA newMaxLBA
		Set the max accessible address of your drive to any value less
		than the device's default native size. A power cycle is
		required after this command before resetting or setting a new
		max LBA.

	--writeCache [info | enable | disable]
		Use this option to enable or disable write cache
		support on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
		the current status of the write cache feature.

		WARNING: Changing Write Cache may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
		         with multiple logical units or namespaces.


	SATA Only:
	========
	--freeFall [info | enable | disable | sensitivity value]	(SATA only)
		Use this option to configure the Free Fall control feature
		found on some SATA drives. This feature allows the drive to
		take action if it detects it is in free fall to protect the data
		from harm due to a drop.
		    info - use this to see the current sensitivity value
		    enable - this option will set the sensitivity to the vendor's
		             recommended value.
		    disable - this will disable the free fall control feature.
		    sensitivity value - set a value between 1 and 255 to control
		                        how sensitive the detection is. A value of zero
		                        will set the vendor's recommended value.

	--lowCurrentSpinup [ low | ultra | disable ]  (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
		Use this option to set the state of the low current spinup
		feature on Seagate SATA drives.
		When this setting is enabled for low or ultra low mode,
		the drive will take longer to spinup and become ready.
		Note: This feature is not available on every drive.
		Note: Some products will support low, but not the ultra
		      low current spinup mode.

	--puisFeature [ enable | disable ]  (SATA Only)
		Use this option to enable or disable the power up in standby
		(PUIS) feature on SATA drives. 
		Note: If this is configured on the drive with a jumper, this
		      command will fail.
		Note2: Not all products support this feature.

	--sscFeature [info | default | enable | disable] (SATA Only) (Seagate Only)
		Use this option to change or view the SSC (Spread Spectrum
		Clocking) mode on a Seagate SATA drive. Only change this
		setting if you are experiencing compatibility problems with
		the drive in a system.
		info - show current SSC state
		default - set to drive default mode
		enable - enable SSC
		disable - disable SSC

	--sctReadTimer [info | value] (SATA Only)
		Use this option to set the read command timer value for
		synchronous commands and NCQ commands with in-order data
		delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at the time that
		the drive processes the command, not the time it is received.
		This timer value is volatile and is cleared at each power cycle.
		Use the "info" argument to get the current status
		of the read timer. A value of 0 means that all possible
		error recovery will be performed before returning status.
		Other values should include a unit to know the time to use.
		If no unit is provided, it is assumed to be the value * 100 ms
		Ex1: --sctReadTimer 15s for a 15 second timer.
		Ex2: --sctReadTimer 15000ms for a 15 second timer expressed in milliseconds
		Ex2: --sctReadTimer 150 for a 15 second timer with no units specified
		The maximum time that can be specified is 1 hour, 49 minutes, 13 seconds
		Note: On some SAT HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
		determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.

	--sctWriteCache [info | enable | disable | default] (SATA Only)
		Use this option to enable or disable write cache
		support on a drive using SMART command transport.
		When using this option, the setting is non-volatile.
		Use this with the --volatile flag to make the
		setting volatile.
		When using this option, the --writeCache option
		will always return success, but no write cache changes
		will occur. This follows ATA spec.
		Using the "default" argument returns the drive to
		default settings and allowing the --writeCache
		option to work again.
		Use the "info" argument to get the current status
		of the write cache feature. Note: On some SAT
		HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
		determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.

	--sctWriteCacheReordering [info | enable | disable | default] (SATA Only)
		Use this option to enable or disable write cache reordering
		support on a drive using SMART command transport.
		Write cache reordering allows the drive to reorder moving data
		out of cache to media for better performance on synchronous
		commands. Asynchronous commands are only affected when in-order
		data delivery is enabled.
		When using this option, the setting is non-volatile.
		Use this with the --volatile flag to make the
		setting volatile.
		Use the "info" argument to get the current status
		of the write cache reordering feature. Note: On some SAT
		HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
		determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.

	--sctWriteTimer [info | value] (SATA Only)
		Use this option to set the write command timer value for
		synchronous commands and NCQ commands with in-order data
		delivery enabled. Note: this timer starts at the time that
		the drive processes the command, not the time it is received.
		This timer value is volatile and is cleared at each power cycle.
		Use the "info" argument to get the current status
		of the write timer. A value of 0 means that all possible
		error recovery will be performed before returning status.
		Other values should include a unit to know the time to use.
		If no unit is provided, it is assumed to be the value * 100 ms
		Ex1: --sctWriteTimer 15s for a 15 second timer.
		Ex2: --sctWriteTimer 15000ms for a 15 second timer expressed in milliseconds
		Ex2: --sctWriteTimer 150 for a 15 second timer with no units specified
		The maximum time that can be specified is 1 hour, 49 minutes, 13 seconds
		Note: On some SAT HBAs/bridges, status will not be able to be
		determined due to HBA/bridge limitations.


	SAS Only:
	========
	--nvCache [info | enable | disable]	(SAS Only)
		Use this option to enable or disable the SCSI Non-Volatile cache
		 on a drive. Use the "info" argument to get
		the current status of the Non-Volatile Cache setting.

		WARNING: Changing NV Cache may affect all LUNs/namespaces for devices
		         with multiple logical units or namespaces.

	--readyLED [info | on | off | default] (SAS Only)
		Use this option to get the current state or change the
		behavior of the ready LED.
		See the SPL spec for full details on how this changes LED
		    info - gets the current state of the ready LED.

		         with multiple logical units or namespaces.

	--sasPhy [phy number] (SAS Only)
		Use this option to specify a specific phy to use
		with another option that uses a phy identifier value.
		Some tool options will assume all SAS Phys when this
		option is not present. Others will produce an error when
		a specific phy is needed for an operation.
		Use the -i option to learn more about the supported phys.

	--scsiLPReset [cumulative | threshold | defCumulative | defThreshold | all]		(SAS only)
		Use this option to reset all SCSI Log Pages.
		If the device is compliant with SPC4 or later, the
		--scsiLPResetPage option may be used to specify a specific page to reset.
		The --volatile option may also be passed to prevent saving changes.
		    cumulative - reset the cumulative values
		    threshold  - reset the threshold values
		    defCumulative - reset the cumulative values to default without saving.
		    defThreshold  - reset the threshold values to default without saving.
		    all - sends the log page reset command to all of the above control values

		         with multiple logical units or namespaces.

	--setSCSIMP [ mp[-sp]:byte:highestBit:fieldWidthInBits=value | file=filename.txt ]	(SAS only)
		Use this option to set a specific field in a mode page to a value.
		There are two argument formats to this option:
		1. The first format expects a mode page (in hex), optionally a subpage code (in hex),
		   the byte offset that the field starts at (in decimal), the highest bit the field starts
		   at (0-7), the width of the field in as a number of bits (decimal), and the value to set (hex or decimal)
		   A maximum of 64bits can be set at a time with this option.
		2. The second format is a text file that contains all bytes of the mode page in hex. Each byte
		   must be separated by a space, new line, or underscore. It is recommended that this file
		   is created by copy-pasting the output of the --showSCSIMP option's default classic view, then modifying
		   after that.		Example use of the arguments:
		1. Setting WCE to zero on caching MP from a file:
		   command line: file=cachingModePage.txt

		  classic - This output is a classic output from old SCSI manuals where the bytes of
		            the page are output in a rows across the screen in hexadecimal format.
		  buffer  - This output is a formatted buffer showing offsets on the top and side in hex.
		            This will output each row with up to 16 bytes of data before moving to the
		            next row.

	--showSCSIMP [page# | page-subpage#]		(SAS only)
		This option will display the specified mode page on the screen as raw
		hexadecimal data bytes. Use --showSCSIMPControl to control the output.
		If --showSCSIMPControl is not provided, the current values will be shown.

	--showSCSIMPControl [current | default | saved | changeable | all]		(SAS only)
		Use this option to control the output of the --showSCSIMP option.
		    current - show the current values of the mode page.

Data Destructive Commands
=========================
	--provision newMaxLBA
		Provision your drive to a new max LBA to any value less
		than the device's current max LBA. A power cycle is required
		after this command before resetting the max LBA or changing
		the provisioning again. This command erases all data between
		the new maxLBA specified and the current maxLBA of the device.
		using a TRIM/UNMAP command.

You can use SeaChest -s --onlySeagate to limit the display to just Seagate.

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the sg or PD device handle (-d, --device).

Lin example, SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg1 --shortDST --poll
Win example, SeaChest_Basics -d PD2 --shortDST --poll

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
in Linux, SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and
SMART.  In Windows, SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -i --smartCheck runs both
identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d /dev/sg# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example, in Linux,
SeaChest_Basics -d /dev/sg0 -d /dev/sg3 -i runs identify on these two
devices.  In Windows, SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on
these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

If the task is an OFFLINE command like format unit or short DST, meaning that
the drive works on the task in the background and the tool quickly returns to
the command prompt (there is little or no I/O to the system), then you can
expect the system to run normally. If the task has high I/O to the system like
a sequential read of all sectors on the drive, then you can expect the system
to slow down with each additional device.

The discussion above is about starting SEQUENTIAL tests, or one after the
other.  When the task does not return to the command prompt for a very long
time, then you have a few options to run tests in PARALLEL, also called
simultaneous, in other words all at the same time.  One way is to start
different drives in different Terminal windows, if available.  There are other
more sophisticated methods using parallel processing, for information about
these methods please see the information at this link:
https://github.com/Seagate/ToolBin/tree/master/SeaChest/parallel_testing

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to -I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time or
-I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

Windows Only Usage
==================
All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like csmi:<controller>:<port>:<lun>.  
If a drive has both a PD? and csmi:?:?:? handle, then SeaChest will show the PD
handle instead of the CSMI handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d csmi:?:?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.
=========================
Linux General Usage Hints
=========================
Remember that Linux file names and command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Display a file listing with the Linux command: ls -lah

The tool will require root privileges to run using either sudo or su commands.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

A dot slash is a dot followed immediately by a forward slash (./). It is used
in Linux to execute a compiled program in the current directory when it is not
a built-in command or found in your path.

For example, ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll
or, sudo ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

Shut down the files system and remove the power with the command:
poweroff

See previous screen history with the key combination:
Shift+PgUp or Shift+PgDn

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.
For example,
SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d /dev/sg0 -i --smartCheck | tee -a mySeaChestLog.txt

Display a log or text file with the Linux "less" command: less myfile.log
Press the letter q to quit displaying the file.  Similarly, you can easily
read the Seagate License agreement by piping the output to the less
command with SeaChest --license |less

Display a list of sg (SCSI generic) devices with the command:
cat /sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/model
or
ls /dev/sg*

sg devices include the following interfaces: SATA, USB, SCSI (SCSI, SAS and FC)

Add the command word 'time' on the same command line before the SeaChest
command to see how much time it takes to run a test.
For example, time ./SeaChest -d /dev/sg0 --shortDST --poll

When drives are not detected by SeaChest
--------------------------------------------
The problem is that the sg driver isn't loaded on the system on boot.  You can
test if it is loaded by doing "ls /dev/sg*" and see if anything shows up. If
nothing shows up then the SG driver is missing (which is required by
SeaChest to issue commands).

You need to do "modprobe sg" as root to load the sg module (since it wasn't
compiled into the kernel), then you will get sg devices that we can scan and
find. Once you run the modprobe command and sg is successfully loaded, then you
can re-run "ls /dev/sg*" and see SG device nodes. SeaChest tools should
then be able to find devices once again.

How to control the amount of runtime kernel messages
----------------------------------------------------
When testing more drives than a system can hold, careful use of host adapters
and hot-plugging batches of drives (but never to direct motherboard
connections!) can help speed the process.  The Linux operating system will
display various system error messages, or none, when storage devices are
powered down and exchanged with the next drives.  The amount of information
contained in the OS error messages can be reviewed using the Linux utility
command "sysctl kernel.printk".  The default setting is defined by the
particular distro.  Tiny Core Linux, for example may set "4 4 1 7".  To hide
hot-plugging messages try "3 4 1 7", to increase the messaging to include
device details like model numbers try "6 4 1 7".  The command to set is 'sudo
sysctl -w kernel.printk="6 4 1 7"'.  See man sysctl - "configure kernel
parameters at runtime" for more.

Tesing storage devices on the USB and Thunderbolt interfaces
------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, when testing a storage device, it is more convenient to attach it as
an external drive to the test system. In the case of SATA drives there are very
many SATA-to-USB 'bridge' adapters available.  The quality and range of command
'passthrough' support for these adapters varies greatly.  Our tools will
attempt to work through these adapters.

If your notebook has a Thunderbolt interface connection then you may be able to
test a wide range of devices.  External Thunderbolt expansion systems provide a
PCIe slot in a chassis that can hold a SAS, NVMe, or SATA host adapter. The
host adapters would have cables that go out to your test bench where you would
provide the drive and an external power supply for the drives. Thunderbolt 2
expansion systems work in Linux by default. Thunderbolt 3 expansion systems
need to be enabled in the kernel with boot time options before it will be
recognized by the Linux operating system. See
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/admin-guide/thunderbolt.html for
information about how to activate the interface.

===========================
Windows General Usage Hints
===========================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\SeaChest --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Setup for Windows
-----------------
The SeaChest Utilities Setup places all of the files at "C:\Program
Files\Seagate\SeaChest" and adds an icon on the Desktop.  Clicking the icon
will open a Windows command prompt in Administrator mode at this location.
From there you will need to type the full command line for the tool and device
and options to run the test you require.  See the various SeaChest Help
documentation for descriptions and examples of the various commands.

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual SeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just
clicking on the file name. If started that way, the SeaChest utility will
briefly show a black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when
trying to run it from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the SeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

SATA SSD SMART Attributes example.

The drive will display its list of supported SMART attributes. Some attributes
are industry standard and most others are vendor unique. Most attributes are
informational and not used to determine a warranty return. Use the --smartCheck
command to determine if one of the warranty attributes has been tripped.

Reminder: Seagate Support does not help to analyze SMART attributes.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 64-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest Format - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure. This tool
also support NVMe format and SATA sector size changes a.k.a. Fast Format. 
Also in this tool is the ability to depopulate a head from use as it wears out
so that the device can continue being used at a reduced capacity until completely
worn out. These complex commands deserve their own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest NVMe - contains some options specific to NVMe devices. This tool started
as a test tool and many options are present in other SeaChest utilities now.

SeaChest PowerControl - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

Various Open Source Licenses

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

*                                                                      *

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
