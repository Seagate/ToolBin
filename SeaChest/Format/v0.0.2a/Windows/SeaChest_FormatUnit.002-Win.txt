===============================================================================
Welcome to Seagate's SeaChest_FormatUnit diagnostic software.

Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces are
able to perform a full low-level media format in the field.  These three
storage interfaces use, in generic terms, the SCSI command set.  Unlike SATA,
which is low-level formatted only at the factory, SCSI command devices are able
to rescan the surface of the media while managing defective sectors (if any)
and even change the drive sector size.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers
many specialty options to accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune
the procedure.

Some RAID adapters, for example, use 520 byte sectors rather than the common
512 size.  Because of this ability to change to a new sector size (also called
block size), the resulting number of total sectors (Logical Block Addresses or
LBAs) on a drive can vary and the actual final count is determined at the end
of the format.  In simple terms, if the new sector size is twice a large as the
previous format then the new count of sectors is half of what it was.

The SCSI Format Unit command is a drive background command which means that
once the command is accepted by the drive it then goes offline to manage the
task with no overhead impact to the host system.  The drive will report
formatting progress in 1% increments.

Important note: Once a Format Unit command has begun on a device then it must
be allowed to complete to be usable again.  If the format is interrupted then
it will subsequently report a  corrupted format with Sense Key "03-31".  The
only way to clear a corrupted format error is to start again and allow it to
finish.

        03h - Medium error. The command was terminated with a non-recoverable
        error condition, probably caused by a flaw in the media or an error in
        the recorded data.
        31h - The media format is corrupted.

Please see the section below "About the SCSI Format Unit Command" for
additional information.

NOTE: SeaChest_FormatUnit may not be fully functional on non-Seagate drives.

it or the data stored on it, then you may still be responsible for the data in
your possession.   To protect yourself from potential liability and to protect
the previous owner's privacy, you should remove all data by performing a data
erasure on this drive.

Be very careful because using SeaChest_FormatUnit will cause data loss. Seagate
is not responsible for lost user data.

Usage
=====
        SeaChest_FormatUnit [-d <device>] {arguments} {options}

Examples
========
        SeaChest_FormatUnit --scan
        SeaChest_FormatUnit -d PD2 -i
        SeaChest_FormatUnit --device PD1 --sanitize info

Utility arguments
=================
        -s, --scan
                Scan the system and list all storage devices with Physical
                Device assignments. Shows model, serial and firmware numbers.
                If your device is not listed on a scan immediately after
                booting, then wait 10 seconds and run it again.

        -F, --scanFlags [option list]
                Use this option with -s to control the output from scan with the
                options listed below. Multiple options can be combined.
                     ata            - show only ATA (SATA) devices
                     usb            - show only USB devices
                     scsi           - show only SCSI (SAS)) devices
                     interfaceATA   - show devices on an ATA interface
                     interfaceUSB   - show devices on a USB interface
                     interfaceSCSI  - show devices on a SCSI or SAS interface
                     ignoreCSMI     - do not scan for any CSMI devices
                     allowDuplicates - allow drives with both CSMI and PD
                                       handles to show up multiple times in the
                                       list.

                Examples of combining two options:
                     -s --scanFlags usb scsi  - show only USB and SAS devices
                     --scan -F ata interfaceSCSI  - show only SATA nearline
                        drives on a SAS adapter

        -d, --device <device handle>
                Use this option with all commands, except --scan, to specify
                the PD physical device handle (target drive) on which to
                perform an operation. See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints'
                for information about defining multiple device handles.

                Example: -d PD0, or -d PD3 (case sensitive).

        -i, --deviceInfo
                Show information and features for the storage device. USB
                devices will show the product name, serial and firmware numbers
                as communicated by the USB-SATA bridge.  Add--usbChildInfo to
                display details about the drive within the USB enclosure.

        --SATInfo                       (SATA only)
                Displays SATA device information on any interface using both
                SCSI Inquiry/VPD/Log reported data (translated according to
                SAT) and the ATA Identify/Log reported data.

        --testUnitReady
                A simple check to see if the device responds to commands from
                interface.  Ready or Not Ready are the outputs.  Not Ready
                results will also include the full SCSI Sense Code.

        --displayLBA [LBA | maxLBA]
                This option will read and display the contents of the specified
                LBA to the screen. The display format is hexadecimal with an
                ASCII translation on the side (when available).  The predefined
                text string "maxLBA" (without quotes) may be entered to
                indicate the last sector on the drive instead of the specific
                LBA number.

        --poll
                Use this option to cause another operation to poll for progress
                until it has completed.  This argument does not return to the
                command prompt and prints ongoing completion percentages (%)
                and the final test result.  Full drive procedures will take a
                very long time.  Used with --sanitize, --secureErase (SATA),
                --writeSame (SATA), or --formatUnit (SAS).

        --progress [format]
                Get the progress for a test that was started quietly (default)
                specify a test to check progress. The progress counts up from
                0% to 100%.

        --showSupportedSectorSizes
                This option will show the supported sector sizes of a device if
                it reports them. These can be used to change the sector size or
                used with a format unit operation. On SAS, this is the
                supported block lengths and protection types VPD page. (SBC4
                and later) On SATA, this is the sector configuration log. (ACS4
                and later) If the device does not report supported sector
                sizes, please consult your product manual.

        --showFormatStatusLog (SAS Only)
                Use this option to view the SCSI format status log. Note: This
                log is only valid after a successful format unit operation.

        --showSupportedProtectionTypes (SAS Only)
                Use this option to view the supported protection types for a
                device.

Utility Options
===============
        -h, --help
                Show utility options and example usage (this output you see now)

        -v [0-4], --verbose [0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4]
                Show verbose information. Verbosity levels are
                0 - quiet
                1 - default
                2 - command descriptions
                3 - command descriptions and values
                4 - command descriptions, values, and data buffers.

                Example: -v 3 or --verbose 3

        -q, --quiet
                Run SeaChest_FormatUnit in quiet mode. This is the same as -v0
                or --verbose 0

        -V, --version
                Show SeaChest_FormatUnit version and copyright information & exit

        --license
                Display the Seagate End User License Agreement (EULA).

        --echoCommandLine
                Shows the command line above the banner in the standard output.
                Useful when saving output to logs.

        --enableLegacyUSBPassthrough
                Only use this option on old USB or IEEE1394 (Firewire) products
                that do not otherwise work with the tool. This option will
                enable a trial and error method that attempts sending various
                ATA Identify commands through vendor specific means. Because of
                this, certain products may respond in unintended ways since
                they may interpret these commands differently than the bridge
                chip the command was designed for.

        --sat12byte
                This forces the lower layer code to issue SAT spec ATA
                Pass-through 12-byte commands when possible instead of 16-byte
                commands.  By default, 16-byte commands are always used for ATA
                Pass-through.  USB products may need this option as a
                workaround if the default does not perform.

        --onlySeagate
                Use this option to match only Seagate drives for the options
                provided.

        --modelMatch [model Number]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                model number. This option will provide a closest match although
                an exact match is preferred. Ex: ST500 will match ST500LM0001

                Note: See the section below 'Tool Usage Hints' for information
                about defining multiple device handles.

        --onlyFW [firmware revision]
                Use this option to run on all drives matching the provided
                firmware revision. This option will only do an exact match.

        --forceATA
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a ATA drive. Only ATA commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --forceATADMA   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to DMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceATAPIO   (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue PIO commands to
                ATA device when possible. This option can be combined with
                --forceATA.

        --forceATAUDMA  (SATA Only)
                Using this option will force the tool to issue SAT commands to
                ATA device using the protocol set to UDMA whenever possible (on
                DMA commands). This option can be combined with --forceATA.

        --forceSCSI
                Using this option will force the current drive to be treated as
                a SCSI drive. Only SCSI commands will be used to talk to the
                drive.

        --csmiIgnorePort
                Use this option to force setting the "ignore Port" flag for the
                port identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiUsePort which will force the passthrough
                to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is intended to help
                troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on systems that are
                otherwise not functional.

        --csmiUsePort
                Use this option to force setting the "Use Port" flag for the
                PHY identifier in a CSMI passthrough command. This option can
                be combined with --csmiIgnorePort which will force the
                passthrough to rely on only the SAS address. This flag is
                intended to help troubleshoot or improve CSMI compatibility on
                systems that are otherwise not functional.

        --csmiVerbose
                Use this option to show some verbose output when running the
                tool on a CSMI handle. The debugging information shown will be
                specific to the CSMI passthrough mechanism and may be useful
                when troubleshooting system/driver compatibility issues.

Data Destructive Commands (Seagate Only)
========================================
Data destructive commands will require additional command line arguments as
confirmation of your understanding that data will be lost on the drive.
Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.

        --confirm I-understand-this-test-will-erase ... etc

        --formatUnit [current | new sector size]    (SAS Only) (Seagate Only)
                This option will start a format unit operation on a SAS drive
                Use "current" to perform a format unit operation with the
                Sector size currently being used, otherwise enter a new sector
                size to use upon format completion. Valid sector sizes are
                listed in the device Product Manual.  This command will erase
                all data on the drive. The security initialize feature is not
                used and protection information will not be set. Combine this
                option with --poll or --progress to check for completion status
                until the format is complete.

        --fastFormat [fast format mode] (SAS Only) (SBC4 required)
                You must use this option with the --formatUnit option to run a
                fast format. Available fast format modes:
                    0 - This is a standard format unit command. All logical
                        blocks will be overwritten. This command will take a
                        very long time.
                    1 - This is a fast format unit command keeping existing
                        data in the physical sector. This option can be used to
                        quickly change the the logical sector size between 5xx
                        emulation and 4xxx native logical block sizes.
                        Resulting LBA (sector) count is either /8 or *8 the
                        current Read Capacity, depending on the direction of
                        the conversion.  The media may be readable, but data
                        may be unspecified or may return errors on read access
                        according to it's error processing algorithms.
                    2 - This is a fast format unit command that can change the
                        logical sector size quickly. Media may or may not be
                        read accessible until a write has been performed to
                        the media.

        --defaultFormat       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to perform a device's default format
                operation.  This in an option flag to the above formatUnit
                command.  This sets the 'format options valid' bit to zero,
                meaning the device performs it's default format options.
                Note: This mode may take a long time to complete.
                Note2: When this option is specified, only the --fastFormat and
                       --discardGList options will be used. All others are
                       ignored.

        --disableCertification       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to disable the certification operation when
                performing a format unit operation.

        --disablePrimaryList       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to disable using the primary defect list when
                performing a format unit operation.

        --discardGList       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to discard the existing grown defect list when
                performing a format unit operation. Set Complete List bit,
                this is the name of the bit in the format unit command. It
                means that a complete defect list was provided in the parameter
                data.  This tells the drive that whatever g-list it knows needs
                to be discarded and to use the one provided.  Because we are not
                giving a g-list, this means it discards the g-list and will
                rediscover the defects during the format.

        --disableImmediateResponse       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to disable the immediate response bit in a
                format unit operation.  This means that the format is run in
                the foreground and doesn't report any status until it is
                complete and cannot be polled.  Not commonly used.
                Note: This mode may take a long time to complete.

        --protectionIntervalExponent [exponent value]       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to specify the protection interval exponent for
                pretoection types 2 & 3. This option is ignored for all other
                protection types.

        --protectionType [ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to specify the protection type to format the
                medium with.
                Note: Not all devices support protection types.

        --pattern [repeat:asciinospaces | random | increment:startValue |
             file:filename]
                Use this option with overwrite, sanitize, and format unit
                operations to write a specific pattern to a range of LBAs or
                the whole drive.

                * repeat - without spaces, enter an ASCII text string or a
                hexadecimal string terminated by a lower case "h". This pattern
                will be repeated until it fills the logical size of the LBA.
                i.e. helloword or FFFFFFFFh
                Note: A hexadecimal pattern will be interpreted as a 32bit
                      unsigned integer. 4 hex bytes (8 characters) must be
                      given for a hex value to be used. Ex: 1F037AC8h or
                      0000FFFFh

                * random - the entire logical sector size will be filled with
                random bytes. This pattern will be written to all LBAs in the
                desired range.

                * increment - enter the starting numerical value. Starting with
                this value, each byte will be written with 1 + previous value.

                * file - user supplied file name to use for a pattern. The file
                will be truncated or padded with zeros to the logical sector
                size.
                Note 1: Each file will be interpreted as a binary file.
                Note 2: A path must also be provided if the file is not in the
                        local directory.
                Note 3: Sanitize Overwrite on SATA only supports a 32bit
                        pattern. The file option will get truncated to a 32bit
                        pattern for SATA products.

        --securityInitialize       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to set the security initialize bit in the
                initialization pattern for a format unit command. SBC
                recommends migrating to sanitize to overwrite previously
                reallocated sectors.
                Note: Not all products support this option.

        --stopOnListError       (SAS Only)
                Use this option to set the stop format bit in a format unit. If
                the device cannot locate or access an existing primary or grown
                defect list, the format will stop and return with an error.

Tool Usage Hints
================
See Sample Output examples below.

First, run the SeaChest_FormatUnit -s option to determine what physical device
assignment lines up to your disk drive. This option will also show you other
details about the drive including the current firmware revision. Like this:

Vendor     Handle   Model Number        Serial Number     FwRev
IDE        PD0      ST94813AS           3AA043KP          3.03
SEAGATE    PD1      ST1000NM0011        ZAA15VAS          SN03

All utility arguments will require you to identify the specific drive by
providing the physical device handle (-d, --device).

For example, SeaChest_FormatUnit -d PD1 --deviceInfo

You may combine multiple tests with a single command line.  For example,
SeaChest_SMART -d PD0 -i --smartCheck runs both identify and SMART.

Multiple device handles can be given by adding -d PD# for each additional
handle.  Devices are processed in sequential order.  For example,
SeaChest_Basics -d PD0 -d PD3 -i runs identify on these two devices.

Caution: All device handles may be specified.  However, great care should be
taken to fully anticipate the consequences of running a command on all storage
devices in a system.  For example, a command to erase data on all drives could
be catastrophic or exactly what you want. The shortcut to select all devices is
-d all.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  Along with the
designation for all devices, you can narrow the tasks to specific types of
drives by using the --onlySeagate, --modelMatch and --onlyFW filters.

All Windows version tools support finding CSMI devices and talking to them like
you would a normal device.  The scan output will show all drives it detects
ONCE. CSMI device handles have a structure like SCSI0:1.  If a drive has both a
PD? and SCSI?:? handle, then SeaChest will show the PD handle instead of the
SCSI (CSMI) handle.

When drives are in a RAID, the PD device handle is usually not available and
the CSMI handle may provide an alternate way to talk to the drive.  Just
because a device has a CSMI handle doesn't mean it is part of a RAID.

If you want to see both handles, add --scanFlags allowDuplicates to the command
line.  If you don't want to see any CSMI devices, add --scanFlags ignoreCSMI to
the command line.  SeaChest_Info -d SCSI?:? --csmiInfo is useful when
troubleshooting CSMI device handles questions.

Tests which alter the firmware or erase user data on the drive are limited to
Seagate-only products which include Seagate, Maxtor, Samsung and LaCie.

Tests which take a very long time to complete or erase all user data on the
drive will require a longer command line argument than indicated in the --help
output to the screen.  This approach is taken to eliminate the possibility of
accidental data loss or the commitment of long test times. The longer command
arguments are similar to "I-understand-this-command-will-take-a-long-time" or
"I-understand-this-command-will-erase-all-data".

Advanced SAS installations may use dual ports.  These are listed as Port 0 and
Port 1 on the device information report. When both ports are active, each one
may have a unique /dev/sg designation.  The scan option may indicate that there
are two drives in the system with the same serial number.  Dual port
installations will also report two different Worldwide Numbers (WWN).

==================================
About the SCSI Format Unit Command
==================================
(from the Seagate SCSI Commands Reference Manual, 100293068 Rev. H July 2014)
http://www.seagate.com/files/staticfiles/support/docs/manual/Interface%20manuals/100293068h.pdf

The FORMAT UNIT command requests that the device server format the medium into
application client accessible logical blocks as specified in the number of
blocks and block length values received in the last mode parameter block
descriptor in a MODE SELECT command. In addition, the device server may certify
the medium and create control structures for the management of the medium and
defects. The degree that the medium is altered by this command is
vendor-specific.

If a device server receives a FORMAT UNIT command before receiving a MODE
SELECT command with a mode parameter block descriptor the device server shall
use the number of blocks and block length at which the logical unit is
currently formatted (i.e., no change is made to the number of blocks and the
block length of the logical unit during the format operation).

The simplest form of the FORMAT UNIT command (i.e., a FORMAT UNIT command with
no parameter data) accomplishes medium formatting with little application
client control over defect management. The device server implementation
determines the degree of defect management that is to be performed. Additional
forms of this command increase the application client's control over defect
management.

The application client may specify:
  a) defect list(s) to be used;
  b) defect locations;
  c) that logical unit certification be enabled; and
  d) exception handling in the event that defect lists are not accessible.

While performing a format operation, the device server shall respond to
commands attempting to enter into the task set except INQUIRY commands, REPORT
LUNS commands, and REQUEST SENSE commands with CHECK CONDITION status with the
sense key set to NOT READY and the additional sense code set to LOGICAL UNIT
NOT READY, FORMAT IN PROGRESS. Handling of commands already in the task set is
vendor-specific. If the device server receives an INQUIRY command, a REPORT
LUNS commands, or a REQUEST SENSE command, then the device server shall process
the command. The device server shall return data for an INQUIRY command based
on the condition of the SCSI target device before beginning the FORMAT UNIT
command (i.e., INQUIRY data shall not change until after successful completion
of a format operation). The processing of commands in the task set when a
FORMAT UNIT command is received is vendor specific.

===================
General Usage Hints
===================
The tool will require Administrative privileges to run.
Also, verify that the tool has executable rights.

Remember that the command line arguments are cAsE SeNsiTiVe.

Save a log file by redirecting the screen output to a text file by adding space
&>test.log at the end of your command line. Choose your own file name. To
append the screen output to an existing log file use >>test.log.

To save a log and display results at the conclusion of the tests, you can use
the powershell "tee" command. Tee command writes to the STDOUT and to a file.

For example:
powershell ".\SeaChest_SMART --echoCommandLine -d PD1 --smartCheck | tee -append mySeaChestLog.txt"

Setup for Windows
-----------------
The SeaChest Utilities Setup places all of the files at "C:\Program
Files\Seagate\SeaChest" and adds an icon on the Desktop.  Clicking the icon
will open a Windows command prompt in Administrator mode at this location.
From there you will need to type the full command line for the tool and device
and options to run the test you require.  See the various SeaChest Help
documentation for descriptions and examples of the various commands.

Manual Launch for Windows
-------------------------
An individual SeaChest utility for Windows cannot be launched by just clicking
on the file name. If started that way, the SeaChest utility will briefly show a
black window box and quickly close.  That is what happens when trying to run it
from the Windows File Manager.

This is a command line tool and the requirement is to open a Command Prompt as
Administrator.  There are two easy ways to do this:
  1. Windows Accessories, right-click the Command Prompt icon and select Run as
     Administrator.
  2. Click Windows Start. In the Start Search box, type cmd, and then press
     CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

Then change drives or directory to where the SeaChest utility is located and
run the tool file name from there.

                     test release.  Branched from SeaChest_Erase v1.4.0.
v0.0.2  14-Jun-2017  1_15_0 libraries adds bug fix malformed command line
                     should exit with code = 1; added detection of parallel ATA
                     and SCSI speeds; temperature data on ATA now uses the
                     values from the SCT status log or device statistics log.
                     Bug fix where the "-d all" was not filtering out csmi
                     drives like it is supposed to causing duplicate drives to
                     show up.  Adds the child drive matching options
                     --childModelMatch, --childOnlyFW, and --childNewFW.

About SeaChest Command Line Diagnostics
=======================================
Seagate offers both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface
(CLI) diagnostic tools for our storage devices.  SeaTools for Windows and
SeaTools Bootable for end users are the two most popular GUI tools.  These
tools support 15 languages.

SeaChest diagnostics are command line utilities which are available for expert
users.  These command line tools assume the user is knowledgeable about running
software from the operating system command prompt.  CLI tools are in the
English language only and use "command line arguments" to define the various
tasks and specific devices.  SeaChest diagnostics are available for both Linux
and Windows environments.

Linux versions of SeaChest tools are available as stand alone 32 or 64-bit
executables you can copy to your own system.  Windows OS versions of SeaChest
diagnostics are installed through a typical setup wizard and can be removed via
the Control Panel.

In addition, Seagate offers a tool to build a bootable USB SeaChest flash drive
which boots to a 32-bit Linux command prompt.  This is a Windows executable
file which formats a USB Flash drive you provide.  It copies over all the files
needed to use it as a bootable device for the SeaChest diagnostic software.
All data on the USB Flash drive will be erased so be sure to protect any
valuable files.

Technical Support for SeaChest drive utilities is not available.  If you have
the time to send us some feedback about this software, especially if you notice
something we should fix or improve, we would greatly appreciate hearing from
you.  To report your comments and suggestions, please use this email
seaboard@seagate.com.  Please let us know the name and version of the tool you
are using.

SeaChest drive utilities support SATA, SAS and USB interface devices.

SeaChest Basics - Contains the most important tests and tools.

Other SeaChest "break out" utilities are available and listed below which offer
more in-depth functionality in specific areas. These are:

SeaChest Configure - Tools to control various settings on the drives are
brought together into this one tool.  Typical commands, for example, include
Write Cache and Read Lookahead Cache enable or disable.

SeaChest Erase - The focus is on data erasure.  There are many different
choices for erasing data from simple boot track erase to full cryptographic
erasure (when supported).  Be sure to back up important data before using this
tool.  Seagate is not responsible for lost user data.  This tool only works on
Seagate drives.

SeaChest Firmware - Seagate products are run by firmware.  Having the latest
firmware can improve performance and or reliability of your product.  Seagate
recommends applying new firmware to enhance the performance and or reliability
of your drive.  Most products may see one or two firmware updates within the
early life of the product.

SeaChest FormatUnit - Storage products which utilize the SAS, SCSI or Fibre
Channel interfaces are able to perform a full low-level media format in the
field.  The SCSI Format Unit command offers many specialty options to
accommodate a variety of conditions and to fine tune the procedure.  This
complex command deserves its own "break out" utility.

SeaChest GenericTests - Read Tests are the original disk drive diagnostic which
is to just read every sector on the drive, sequentially.  This tool offers
several common read tests which can be defined by either time or range.  In
addition, the Long Generic test has the ability to repair problem sectors,
possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

SeaChest Info - Historical generic activity logs (like total bytes written and
power on hours) and performance logs (like temperature) are available for
analytical review.  Identification and inquiry data stored on the drive is also
provided.  A view of SMART and device statistics is available when supported by
the drive.

SeaChest PowerChoice - Seagate disk drives offer a multitude of options to
manage power.  This tool manipulates the various power modes.

SeaChest Security - Various settings are available on modern Seagate disk
drives which may be locked and unlocked.  These settings may interact with the
operating systems and systems BIOS.  Options also include cryptographic erase
for Self-Encrypting Drives (SED).

SeaChest SMART - This tool provides a closer look at the collected SMART
attributes data.  SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology.  Short Drive Self Test is included as one of the standard SMART
commands. In addition, the DST & Clean test has the ability to repair problem
sectors, possibly eliminating an unnecessary drive return.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (c) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful, or

* b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License.

* b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
document.

* d) Do one of the following:
  o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and
under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application
with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.
  o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
properly with a modified version of the Library that is
interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

* e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
terms of this License.

* b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
